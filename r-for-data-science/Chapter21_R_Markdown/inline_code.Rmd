```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
smaller <- diamonds %>%
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats. The
distribution of the remainder is shown below:


When inserting numbers into text, format() is your friend. It allows
you to set the number of digits so you don't print to a ridiculous
degree of accuracy, and a big.mark to make numbers easier to read.
I'll often combine these into a helper function:

```{r}
comma <- function(x) format(x, digits = 2, big.mark = ",")
comma(3452345)
comma(.12358124331)
```
