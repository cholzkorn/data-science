CITY RUINS - NIGHT\\n\\n        Same spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell.  The\\n        cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper.  The\\n        skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some\\n        unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles.\\n        Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten\\n        million dead souls.

BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT\\n\\n        THE BATTLE.  Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for\\n        possession of the dead Earth.  The humans are a ragtag guerrilla\\n        army.  Skynet\\'s weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot\\n        gun-platforms), flying Aerial HKs, four-legged gun-pods called\\n        Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms.\\n\\n        SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS:\\n5A      Explosions!

Another (complete cyborg),\\n        with flesh ripped open and back broken, gropes for a rifle on the\\n        ground.\\n\\n5G      A Centurion overruns a human firing position.

Fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing\\n        machines.\\n\\n6       IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle, a man watches\\n        the combat with night-vision binoculars.

A patch covers that eye.  An\\n        impressive man, forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war.  The name\\n        stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR.

As before, the\\n                Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.  A\\n                protector for John.

TRUCKSTOP - NIGHT\\n\\n        Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon\\n        formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot\\n        of an all-night truck stop.  Then...\\n\\n        The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in\\n        the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.\\n        Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!\\n\\n        Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man.\\n        TERMINATOR has come through.  Physique: massive, perfect.  Face:\\n        devoid of emotion.  Terminator stands and impassively surveys its\\n        surroundings.\\n\\n8       INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT\\n\\n        On a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over\\n        chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are\\n        playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the\\n        table\\'s rail.  The dive\\'s owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a\\n        soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on...\\n\\n        Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that\\n        doesn\\'t happen every night.  All eyes simultaneously swivel toward\\n        Terminator.  Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it\\n        walks calmly through the room.  Everyone frozen, not sure how to\\n        react.\\n\\n8A      TERMINATOR POV.  A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid\\n        with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye\\n        can follow.  In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the\\n        owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking\\n        biker puffing on a cigar.  His body is outlined, or \"selected\", and\\n        thousands of estimated measurements appear.  His clothing has been\\n        analyzed and deemed suitable...\\n\\n8B                              TERMINATOR\\n                I need your clothes, your boots, and your\\n                motorcycle.\\n\\n        The big biker\\'s eyes narrow.  He takes a long draw on this cigar,\\n        the tip cherry-red hot.\\n\\n                                CIGAR BIKER\\n                You forgot to say please.\\n\\n        He grinds the cigar out on Terminator\\'s chest.  Which produces not\\n        the slight reaction of pain.  Terminator calmly, and without\\n        expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm...\\n        Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.\\n\\n        Terminator doesn\\'t see Cigar\\'s friend, behind him, holding his pool\\n        cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.  The heavy send\\n        whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of\\n        Terminator\\'s head.\\n\\n        Terminator seems not to notice.  Doesn\\'t even blink.  Without\\n        releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs\\n        Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.  Suddenly the heavyset biker\\n        finds himself flying through the nearest window.  CRAASSH!\\n\\n        Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar,\\n        through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the\\n        big flat GRILL.  We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar\\n        screams, flopping jerking.  He rolls off in a smoking heap.\\n\\n        The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes\\n        at Terminator\\'s face.\\n\\n        Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.  Holding it by\\n        the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy\\'s hand.\\n        Ultra-fast here: He flips it.  Grabs the handle like you\\'re supposed\\n        to hold a knife.  Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the\\n        bar.  Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker\\'s\\n        shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.\\n\\n9       INT. KITCHEN\\n\\n        The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in.\\n        The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar,\\n        who is cursing in pain on the floor.\\n\\n        With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto\\n        tucked under his leather jacket.  But he can\\'t even hold onto it.\\n        Terminator takes it from him.  Instead of pointing it at him,\\n        Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and\\n        operating condition.  Terminator never threatens... that\\'s a human\\n        thing.  He just takes.\\n\\n        Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to\\n        him.  He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator\\'s\\n        foot.  Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.\\n\\n10      INT. TRUCK STOP\\n\\n        Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black\\n        leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots.  He\\n        moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table.  Without\\n        slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.  The guy slumps to the\\n        floor, groaning, behind him.\\n\\n        Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd,\\n        the owner.  At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit\\n        frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.  One of the truckers finally\\n        nods.\\n\\n                                TRUCKER\\n                Evening...\\n\\n        Terminator impassively stares back.  Then moves on out the door.\\n\\n11      EXT. TRUCK STOP\\n\\n        Terminator walks out, surveying the parked Harleys.  Sticks the .45\\n        in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE.\\n        He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition.  Kicks\\n        over the engine.  It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron\\n        into gear with a KLUNK.\\n\\n        Lloyd appears at the diner\\'s door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE\\n        WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN.  He fires into the air and jacks\\n        around round in fast, aiming at Terminator\\'s back.\\n\\n                                LLOYD\\n                I can\\'t let you take the man\\'s wheels, son.\\n                Now get off or I\\'ll put you down.\\n\\n        Terminator turns and considers by coldly.  He eases the shifter up\\n        into neutral.  Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.  Swings him leg\\n        over and walks calmly toward the guy.\\n\\n        Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the\\n        shotgun\\'s muzzle.  Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he\\'s\\n        going to kill a man in cold blood.  He\\'s still trying to decide when\\n        Terminator\\'s hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow\\n        suddenly holding the shotgun.\\n\\n        Lloyd gapes, knowing he\\'s screwed.  Then...\\n        Terminator reaches toward him.  Oh shit...\\n        And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd\\'s shirt pocket.  Puts them on.\\n        Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.\\n\\n12      EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT\\n\\n        Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A.  Cold neon flares\\n        across the chrome of the big bike.  The 10-gauge is jammed through\\n        the clutch and brake cables, across the handlebars.  The lights flow\\n        over Terminator\\'s wrap-around sunglasses like the tracks of tracer\\n        rounds.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n13      EXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT\\n\\n        The First Street Bridge.  Rusting chain-link fence and graffiti-\\n        covered walls.  An L.A.P.D. BLACK-AND-WHITE cruises the empty street.\\n\\n        A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the columns\\n        of the overpass.  The young UNIFORMED COP in the car whips his head\\n        around at the source of the light.  He pulls over quickly, in time\\n        to see...\\n\\n13A     The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between\\n        the columns.  Lightning climbs the chain-link fence and light\\n        standards, lighting up the night, and papers swirl in a blasting\\n        whirlwind.\\n\\n13B     The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades.\\n        He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the\\n        strange light.  He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the\\n        shadows between the rows of pillars.\\n\\n        A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop.  Nothing\\n        special about him.  Certainly not built like a terminator.  The flash\\n        of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he\\n        just arrived from the future.  His features are handsome bordering\\n        on severe.  His eyes are gray ice.  Penetrating.  Intelligent.\\n\\n        THE COP spins at a sound.  Too late.  Mr. X is already on him.  The\\n        blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand.\\n\\n        LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his BERETTA 9mm\\n        AUTOMATIC clattering next to him.  A hand ENTERS FRAME and picks up\\n        this pistol.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n13C     HIGHLY POLISHED BLACK SHOES rounding the rear tire of the police\\n        cruiser.  FOLLOW THE SHOES to the cruiser\\'s door then MOVE UP as\\n        Mr. X, dressed now in LAPD blue, climbs behind the wheel.  He\\n        looks and acts exactly like a cop.  Cool, alert, confident in his\\n        power, his expression emotionless and judgmental.\\n        Mr. X, now Officer X, puts the car in gear and drives into the night.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n14      INT.

He has\\n        ripped Levi\\'s and long stringy hair.  A sullen mouth.  Eyes which\\n        reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel.  The Ramones\\' \"I Wanna\\n        Be Sedated\" blasts from a boom box next to him.\\n\\n        A WOMAN, JANELLA VOIGHT, stands in the doorway of the garage,\\n        yelling over the music.\\n\\n                                WOMAN\\n                ...John?

GARAGE\\n\\n        John hops on the bike.  Kick-starts it.  Tim picks up John\\'s nylon\\n        bag, then climbs on the back.  Todd ENTERS and shouts over the\\n        engine, which John revs louder and louder.\\n\\n                                TODD\\n                John!

Backlit,\\n        eyes concealed by the sunglasses, it stands over her like the angel\\n        of death itself.  It reaches down and...\\n        Takes her hand.  Lifts her up.

The children, charcoal statues frozen in positions\\n        of play, explode into black leaves of ash and swirl away.  SOUND\\n        hit now, with a thunderous roar.  Sarah\\'s scream merges with the\\n        howl of the wind as the blast hits her, exploding the flesh from her\\n        bones.  Beside her, Terminator is stripped of its burnt flesh,\\n        becoming a smoking skeleton of steel.\\n\\n30E     Then she wake up... in her cell, shackled to the bed.  Sunlight hurts\\n        her eyes.  She looks desperate and defeated.  She knows the war is\\n        coming.  It visits her every time she closes her eyes.  Lost and\\n        alone, Sarah feels all hope recede for herself and for humanity.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n31      INT.

Terminator reaches into the box of roses.\\n\\n        SLOW MOTION.  The cold back steel of the SHOTGUN emerges at the box\\n        falls open, the roses spilling to the floor.  TERMINATOR\\'S BOOT\\n        crushes the flowers as it moves forward.\\n\\n        JOHN, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless\\n        shooting gallery of the corridor.  THE SHOTGUN COMES UP.  Terminator\\n        expressionlessly strides forward.  Jacks a round into the chamber,\\n        slow and fluid.\\n\\n        John looks behind him for a place to run.  Sees the cop coming toward\\n        him, pulling his Beretta pistol.  Incredibly, John realizes the cop\\n        is aiming his gun at him!\\n        John looks back at Terminator.  He is starting into the black muzzle\\n        of the 10-gauge now.  Aimed right at his head.  He realizes he\\'s\\n        screwed.  Then something crazy happens...\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Get down.\\n\\n        John instinctively ducks.  Terminator pulls the trigger. KABOOM!\\n\\n        THE COP catches the SHOTGUN\\'S BLAST square in the chest just as he\\n        fires the pistol.  The pistol\\'s shot goes wild.\\n\\n        TERMINATOR pumps another round into him.  The another.  And another.\\n        Advancing a step each time he fires, he empties the shotgun into the\\n        cop, blowing his backward down the corridor.  The sound is DEAFENING.\\n        Then silence.\\n\\n        THE COP lies still on his back.\\n\\n44A     Terminator is now standing right over John.  They both watch as the\\n        cop, incredibly, sits up unharmed and gets to his feet.  Terminator\\n        grabs John roughly by his jacket.  Clutches the kid to his chest\\n        then spins around at the cop opens fire with the Beretta.\\n\\n44B     The \"cop\", who not only isn\\'t a cop, he clearly isn\\'t even human,\\n        pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol.\\n\\n        ON TERMINATOR\\'S BACK, as the 9mm slugs slam into it, punching bloody\\n        holes in the motorcycle jacket.\\n\\n        JOHN is bug-eyed with fear, but completely unscratched.  Terminator\\'s\\n        body has blocked the bullets.\\n\\n        The Beretta CLACKS empty.  Terminator turns at the sound.\\n        Shoves John behind a Coke machine.  Drops the empty shotgun.  Starts\\n        walking toward the \"cop\".\\n        The empty magazine clatters to the floor.\\n        The cop inserts another one.  Snaps back the slide.\\n        Terminator still has twenty feet to go.\\n        He doesn\\'t break his purposeful stride.\\n\\n        The cop opens fire.  Bullets rake Terminator\\'s chest.  He doesn\\'t\\n        even flinch.\\n        Ten feet to go.  BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Neither the cop nor Terminator\\n        show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator\\'s\\n        wardrobe to shreds.\\n\\n        CLACK.  The pistol empties again.  Terminator stops two feet in front\\n        of the cop.  The appraise each other for a second.\\n\\n        We realize now that the cop is a terminator too.  We don\\'t know the\\n        details yet, but let\\'s call him the T-1000 (since that\\'s what he is).\\n        A newer model than the one we\\'ve come to know so well (the 800\\n        Series \"Arnold\").  This guy\\'s a prototype... and he\\'s got quite a\\n        few surprises.\\n\\n        T-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up.  Terminator moves first.\\n        He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a\\n        counter-grip.  After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls\\n        on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and\\n        the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and\\n        disappeared.\\n\\n        JOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move.  He staggers to\\n        his feet.  Stumble-runs toward the parking garage.\\n\\n44C     THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE.  A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator\\n        crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the\\n        screaming crowd.\\n\\n44D     T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after\\n        John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run.\\n\\n44E     Terminator is totally still.  A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps\\n        forward and takes a picture of the body.  Suddenly, Terminator\\'s\\n        eyes snap open.  The stunned tourist backs away.\\n\\n        He sits up and looks around.  Gets his bearings.  Rises smoothly to\\n        his feet.  All servos seem to be working fine.  The tourist\\'s camera\\n        whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show.\\n        The owner isn\\'t even looking through the eyepiece, he\\'s so shocked.\\n\\n45      INT. PARKING GARAGE\\n\\n        John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared\\n        shitless and the damned thing won\\'t start.  His hands are shaking so\\n        badly he can\\'t find the choke.  He looks up to see --\\n        The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him.\\n        John fumbles with the choke.  The bike catches.  He slams it in gear\\n        and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage.\\n\\n        John looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.  He twists the\\n        throttle and guns the little bike forward.  Incredibly, the T-1000\\n        is gaining.  This nightmare isn\\'t happening.  John races out the exit\\n        ramp, and charges right into the street.\\n\\n46      EXT. STREET\\n\\n        John shoots into the busy traffic.  Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK.\\n        The DRIVER swears.  Hits his air horn.  What the driver doesn\\'t see\\n        is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who\\n        emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck.\\n\\n46A     IN THE TRUCK.  The driver hears a thump as something slams against his\\n        door, then feels himself pulled right out.  T-1000 slides in and\\n        takes his place.  The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph.\\n        T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.  It can see him,\\n        up ahead, weaving through traffic.\\n\\n46B     Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the\\n        Harley.\\n        He accelerates after the others.\\n\\n47      EXT. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL\\n\\n        John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he\\'s ever done\\n        it before.  He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a\\n        narrower tributary which has vertical sides.\\n\\n        He looks back.  No sign of pursuit.\\n47A     Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow.\\n        The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring\\n        diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right\\n        into the center of the canal.\\n\\n        It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an\\n        angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of\\n        metal.  It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing\\n        like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering\\n        speed.\\n\\n47B     John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow\\n        concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike\\n        has.  The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train\\n        in a tunnel.  Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray,\\n        backlit in the setting sun.  It looks like some kind of demon.  And...\\n        it\\'s gaining.\\n\\n47C     ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is\\n        fighting to overtake them.  He looks down and sees John with the tow-\\n        truck from Hell catching up to him.  It is only about twenty feet\\n        behind him and still gaining.\\n\\n47D     ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall\\n        of metal filling frame behind him.\\n\\n47E     ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the\\n        road.  Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into\\n        the air like Steve McQueen in \"The Great Escape\" and vaults the fence\\n        bordering the canal.  It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears\\n        along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the\\n        truck in the canal below.\\n\\n47F     John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed.  The\\n        massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back\\n        fender.  Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.  All this is happening at\\n        about sixty miles and hour.  Top speed for the little dirt bike.\\n\\n47G     SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again.  This time the 700-\\n        pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.  It arcs\\n        down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.  It bottoms\\n        out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.  Only the ultra-fast\\n        reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.  Terminator fights\\n        for control.\\n\\n47H     He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John\\'s tiny\\n        Honda.\\n        Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him\\n        onto the Harley, in front of him.  John\\'s Honda weaves and falls,\\n        smashing instantly under thundering tires.\\n\\n        The Harley roars ahead.  It hits eighty.  Ahead is an overpass, and\\n        supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two\\n        channels.  The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially\\n        a short tunnel.\\n\\n47I     The truck can\\'t fit on either side.  Neither can it stop, at that\\n        speed.  Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into\\n        the concrete abutment at seventy.\\n\\n47J     Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a\\n        fireball blasting through behind them as the truck\\'s side-tanks\\n        explode.\\n\\n        Terminator stops the Harley.  John peers around his body to see the\\n        destruction.  A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in\\n        the mud.  Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal,\\n        disappearing around a bend.\\n\\n47K     ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass.\\n        Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of\\n        flame.  A figure appears in the fire.\\n        Just an outline.  Walking slowly... calmly.\\n        The figure emerges from the flames.\\n\\n        It is human-shaped but far from human.  A smooth chrome man.  Not a\\n        servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex\\n        hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome\\n        surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.  It\\n        reminds us of mercury.  A mercury man.  Its face is simple, unformed.\\n        Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us.\\n\\n        With each step detail returns.\\n        First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid\\n        chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features,\\n        ears...\\n\\n47K     But it\\'s still al chrome.  With its last step, the color returns to\\n        everything.  It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair,\\n        mustache.  Icy eyes.  It stops and looks around.\\n\\n        It is a perfect chameleon.  A liquid metal robot.  A killing machine\\n        with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society.\\n\\n47L     ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up.\\n        T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them.  More cops arrive.  T-1000\\n        blends in perfectly.  There are always cops at diasters and scenes of\\n        violence.  We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so\\n        perfect.\\n        It walks among the other cops unnoticed.\\n        Gets into one of the squad cars.  Starts it and drives away.\\n\\n48      EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT\\n\\n        Terminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the\\n        empty street.  John cranes his neck around to get a look at the\\n        person/thing he is riding with.  The image is strangely reminiscent\\n        of father/son, out for an evening ride.\\n\\n        John is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and\\n        he\\'s just a ten-year kid, but he\\'s also John Connor who will someday\\n        rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Whoa... time out.  Stop the bike!\\n\\n        Terminator immediately complies.  He leans the bike into a turn.\\n        They head into a nearby alley.\\n\\n49      EXT. ALLEY\\n\\n        Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop.  John\\n        slides off the gas tank.  Terminator impassively stares at him.  John\\n        checks him out.  Tentatively speaks.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Now don\\'t take this the wrong way, but you are\\n                a terminator, right?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                No way!\\n\\n        John touches Terminator\\'s skin.  Then the blood on his jacket.\\n        His mind overloads as the reality of it hits him.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Holy shit... you\\'re really real!  I mean...\\n                whoah!\\n                        (stepping back)\\n                You\\'re, uh... like a machine underneath, right...\\n                but sort of alive outside?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                I\\'m a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over\\n                a metal endoskeleton.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh...\\n                you\\'re not here to kill me... I figured that part\\n                out for myself.  So what\\'s the deal?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                My mission is to protect you.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Yeah?  Who sent you?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed\\n                me to be your protector here, in this time.\\n\\n        John gives him an amazed look.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                This is deep.\\n\\n50      EXT. STREET - NIGHT\\n\\n        John and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side\\n        streets.  They blend into the evening traffic.  In the darkness,\\n        Terminator\\'s wounds are not readily visible.  John cranes his head up\\n        and back.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                So this other guy?  He\\'s a terminator too,\\n                right, like you?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype.\\n                A mimetic polyalloy.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                What does that mean?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Liquid metal.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Radical.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                You are targeted for termination.

The T-1000 will definitely try to\\n                reacquire you there.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                You sure?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                I would.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n51      EXT. PAYPHONE\\n\\n        John is quickly going through his pockets for change.  He has plenty\\n        of bills but no quarters.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta\\n                warn them.  Shit!  You got a quarter?\\n\\n        Terminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off the\\n        phone\\'s cash box with the heel of his hand.  A shower of change\\n        tumbles out.  Terminator hands one to John.  John dials.\\n\\n52      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\\n\\n        Janelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her\\n        shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife.\\n        She answers sweetly.\\n\\n                                JANELLE\\n                Hello?\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                        (filtered through phone)\\n                Janelle?  It\\'s me.\\n\\n        In the backyard, John\\'s German Shepherd is going bonkers, barking at\\n        something.\\n\\n                                JANELLE\\n                John?  Where are you, honey?  It\\'s late.  You\\n                should come home, dear.  I\\'m making a casserole.\\n\\n        AT THE PAYPHONE.  John listens, an odd look on his face.  He covers\\n        the phone\\'s mouthpiece and turns to Terminator.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                        (whispering)\\n                Something\\'s wrong.  She\\'s never this nice.\\n\\n        IN THE VOIGHTS\\' KITCHEN.  Todd comes through the kitchen\\'s back door.\\n        Just home from work.  He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge.  Grabs\\n        a carton of milk.  Takes a sip.  Frowns at the dog\\'s barking.\\n\\n                                TODD\\n                What the hell\\'s the goddamn dog barking at?\\n                SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!\\n\\n        TIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her.  He\\n        passes OUT OF FRAME next to her.  Janelle switches the phone to her\\n        other hand then... THUNK!  Her free hand seems to do something out of\\n        frame.  There is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto\\n        the floor. (Don\\'t go away.

Calm.\\n\\n        PAN OVER along her arm, which is stretched out straight from the\\n        shoulder.  Partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into\\n        something else... a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-like\\n        spike.  Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by the\\n        spike which has punched through his milk carton, through his mouth\\n        and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door.  His eyes are\\n        glassy and lifeless.\\n\\n        The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT! -- so rapidly, Todd is actually\\n        standing there a second before he slumps out of sight.  THUMP.\\n53A     Janelle doesn\\'t bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and\\n        color, transforming back into a hand, and then...\\n\\n53B     JANELLE CHANGES rapidly into the COP we now know as the T-1000.  The\\n        change has liquid quality.  T-1000 opens the back door.\\n\\n54      EXT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT\\n\\n        T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it,\\n        barking in fear.  T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP.  Reaches down, OUT\\n        OF FRAME.  We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP.\\n        Then T-1000\\'s hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar.\\n        The tag reads \"MAX\".\\n        T-1000 nods thoughtfully.  Heads back to the house.\\n\\n55      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\\n\\n        Dark.  Off a quiet street.  Terminator stands near the Harley,\\n        watching John pace before him.

VOIGHT HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\n        T-1000 walks down the dark hall.  It passes the bathroom and we see\\n        the real Janelle\\'s legs through the half-open door.  The shower is\\n        running.  Her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor.\\n\\n56A     In John\\'s bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in the\\n        dark.\\n        Calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any clues that\\n        could lead it to its target.  T-1000 finds a box of audio cassettes\\n        marked \"Messages from Mom\".  In it are some letters, and envelopes\\n        filled with snapshots.  It begins looking through some of the\\n        photos...\\n\\n        SHOT OF JOHN AND SARAH during the missing years.  Sarah in olive\\n        cammos with an RPG 7 grenade launcher, teaching John how to aim.\\n        Sarah with a group of military-clad Guatemalan men, standing next to\\n        cases of Stinger missiles.  John and Sarah in a Contra camp, deep in\\n        the mountains.\\n\\n57      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\\n\\n        John is now sitting on the curb, lost in stunned thought.  Terminator\\n        stands above him, watching the street like a Doberman.  He glances\\n        down at John.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places\\n                like that.  For a while she was with this crazy\\n                ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there\\n                were some other guys.  She\\'d shack up with\\n                anybody she could learn from.  So then she\\n                could teach me how to be this great military\\n                leader.  Then she gets busted and it\\'s like...\\n                sorry kid, your mom\\'s a psycho.  Didn\\'t you\\n                know?  It\\'s like... everything I\\'d been brought\\n                up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right?\\n                I hated her for that.\\n                        (he looks up)\\n                But everything she said was true.\\n                        (he stands)\\n                We gotta get her out of there.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Negative.  The T-1000\\'s highest probability for\\n                success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and\\n                wait for you to make contact with her.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Oh, great.

This is great!\\n\\n        The two guys get there and look at Terminator standing there calmly\\n        with one leg up in the air.  This big guy in black leather and dark\\n        glasses, standing like a statue.\\n\\n                                FIRST JOCK\\n                Hey, kid.

No longer needing to be rescued.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Take a hike, bozo.\\n\\n                                FIRST JOCK\\n                Yeah?

The guy\\'s friend jumps behind\\n        Terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson --\\n        Terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car --\\n        Grabs the second by the hair, whips out his .45 in a quick blur, and\\n        aims the muzzle at the guy\\'s forehead.\\n        John grabs Terminator\\'s arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger --\\n        John\\'s weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches.  The\\n        guy flinches, stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear.  He stares,\\n        shocked.  Pissing himself.  John is freaking out, too.\\n        He screams at Terminator.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Put the gun down!

Fast.  John grabs Terminator by the arm and tugs him toward\\n        the bike.  John still holds the gun, reluctant to give it back.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Of course.

Having your own terminator just became a little\\n        bit less fun to him.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Listen to me, very carefully, okay?

He gets a glimpse of the responsibility\\n        that comes with power.  Finally he hands the .45 back to Terminator,\\n        who puts it away.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Look, I\\'m gonna go get my mom.

She\\n        goes to the counter and leans out to see if he\\'s at the drinking\\n        fountain or someplace.  No.  Reception is empty.  And so is the long\\n        corridor beyond.  She frowns.  Too weird.\\n\\n66A     Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and\\n        Weathersby, the two uniformed cops, and the hospital security guard.\\n        The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind the\\n        night desk.

Silberman goes back into the secure area of\\n        the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the main\\n        doors.  No sign of T-1000.  Mossberg and the other cops exit, and\\n        the guard locks the door behind them.\\n\\n66B     The guard walks slowly back along the long corridor.  The hall is\\n        dark, with the light at the night desk far ahead like a sanctuary.\\n        His footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor.  His keys jingle.\\n\\n66C     ANGLE ON FLOOR as the guard\\'s feet pass through FRAME.  An instant\\n        later the floor starts to move.\\n        It shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass, still retaining the\\n        two-tone checkerboard of the tile.  It hunches up silently into a\\n        quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard.\\n\\n66D     Up ahead we hear typing.  The night nurse has her back to us, working.\\n        The guard stops as the drinking fountain.  Bends to take a sip.\\n        Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to\\n        resolve rapidly into a human figure.  It loses the color and texture\\n        of the tile and becomes... THE GUARD.\\n\\n        T-1000\\'s mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over\\n        several square yards of floor.  The guard walked over the T-1000, and\\n        his structure was sampled that instant.  Now we see it drawing in and\\n        pulling up to form the figure of the guard.\\n\\n        The T-1000/Guard\\'s feet are the last to form, the last of the \"liquid\\n        floor\" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes.  The shoes detach\\n        with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-1000/Guard\\n        takes its first step.\\n\\n66E     The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself.\\n        He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of\\n        that.  Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and,\\n        inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real\\n        guard\\'s face, about a foot away.  In a split second, the finger\\n        spears out, elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a\\n        stiletto, slamming into the guard\\'s eye.\\n        It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans-\\n        orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard\\'s skull.\\n\\n        Life quietly empties from the guard\\'s face.  He is dead weight,\\n        hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK.  As the\\n        guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and\\n        walks him, like it\\'s carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the\\n        night desk.  The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor.\\n\\n66F     ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past,\\n        dragging something casually which she can\\'t see because it\\'s below\\n        the countertop.\\n\\n                                NIGHT NURSE\\n                Whatcha got, Lewis?\\n\\n                                T-1000/GUARD\\n                Just some trash.\\n\\n        She nods, uninterested.  Keeps typing.  T-1000 moves past, dragging\\n        the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night\\n        receiving station.  T-1000/Guard removes the Browning High-Power\\n        pistol and the keys from the real guard\\'s belt, then stuffs the body\\n        into the utility closet.\\n\\n66G     INT.

Instead of\\n        setting the gun in the locker, it inserts the pistol into it own\\n        chest, where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of\\n        hot fudge.  It withdraws its hand.  The chest is once again a surface\\n        that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc.  You\\'d ever guess it was\\n        really an intelligent liquid metal.\\n\\n        T-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button\\n        unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK.  T-1000/Guard goes through.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n67      INT.

She\\n        jams it into the orderly\\'s butt and fires the whole shot.  Still\\n        holding the empty syringe, she sees what she need next.\\n        They keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the inmates from\\n        drinking Drano.  She grabs a plastic jug of LIQUID PLUM\\'R and slams\\n        it down on the desk inches from Silberman\\'s eyes.\\n\\n        She jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug.\\n        Draws back the plunger.  The syringe fills with blue liquid.\\n        She whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into Silberman\\'s neck.\\n        His horrified eyes rack toward it.  10 cc\\'s of blue death fill the\\n        cylinder.\\n        Her thumb hovers over the plunger.\\n        She jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip on him,\\n        then hauls him through the door.\\n\\n69      IN THE CORRIDOR outside cell #19 the T-1000 stops and looks in the\\n        window.

A jail-cell type barred\\n        door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond.\\n        She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door.\\n        She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of\\n        the one she just came through being unlocked.\\n\\n        She flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first\\n        orderly comes through behind her.\\n        She slams the bars shut.  CLANG.\\n        Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her.\\n        The orderly is racing at her, white-lipped with rage.\\n\\n        She reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully\\n        snaps it off in the lock.  An instant later the big orderly slams\\n        against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances\\n        back just out of reach.\\n        He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off.\\n\\n        Sarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies.\\n        They\\'re shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the\\n        lock --\\n        The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in.\\n        Silberman shouts at them.\\n\\n                                SILBERMAN\\n                Go around, goddamnit!  Go around!!\\n\\n        The orderlies run back the way they came, and along a cross-corridor\\n        to another set of doors.\\n\\n73B     ON SARAH as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead.\\n        Now she\\'s home-free.  At a full-tilt sprint, she\\'s nearly there when\\n        the elevator doors part...\\n\\n        TERMINATOR steps out... his head swivels to face her.\\n        Sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares.\\n        Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward.\\n        Her bare feet slip on the slick tile.  She slams to the floor,\\n        staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun.\\n\\n        She loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity.\\n        She\\'s not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be\\n        screaming if she could get the breath to do it.\\n        In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a\\n        crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall.\\n\\n        She runs like the wind, like in her nightmare.  If she looked back she\\n        would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind\\n        Terminator.  John, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing Sarah and\\n        figures out instantly what happened.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Mom!!  Wait!\\n\\n        Sarah doesn\\'t hear.  She has clicked fully into her own nightmare.\\n        They take off running after Sarah.\\n\\n73C     She is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came.  As she\\n        reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad figure\\n        blurs from that corridor.  The orderly hits her in a flying tackle.\\n        She skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling.  The other two\\n        orderlies leap into the fray.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                No!  Help me!  Goddamnit, it\\'s gonna kill us\\n                all!!!\\n\\n        She is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is\\n        coming.  They grab her thrashing arms and legs.  They don\\'t even look\\n        where the out-of-control woman is pointing... back along the corridor.\\n\\n        They have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her.\\n        Silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of\\n        trank.  Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of\\n        Terminator coming up behind them.  It is exactly her nightmare.\\n        She screams in utter hopelessness.\\n\\n        Terminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs\\n        one of the orderlies with his other hand.  He hurls the 200-pound\\n        guys against the far wall of the corridor.  SMACK!  He drops to the\\n        floor.\\n        The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder.\\n        Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys.\\n        Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are\\n        flung outward like they stepped on a land mine.\\n        One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a\\n        two-story fall by the outer steel bars.  The other crashes through an\\n        office door, splintering it into kindling.\\n\\n        Silberman has jumped to hold Sarah.  He is grabbed by a roll of skin\\n        at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat.  The doctor feel his\\n        feet pedaling above the ground.  He looks into the expressionless\\n        face.  And it hit him.  Sarah was right... this guy isn\\'t human.\\n        He feels the fabric of reality crumbling.\\n        Then he feels himself flying through the air.  The wall smacks him,\\n        then the floor kicks him in the face.  He decides to lie there a\\n        second.\\n\\n        Sarah blinks, staring up at the figure looming over her.\\n        John kneels next to her.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Mom, are you okay?\\n\\n        She looks from Terminator to John.  Back to Terminator.\\n        Is this a nightmare?  Or has she finally gone truly bad?\\n\\n        Incredibly, Terminator politely reaches his hand down to her, offering\\n        to help her up.  The last thing she ever expected to see.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Come with me if you want to live.\\n\\n        The orderlies are stirring.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                It\\'s all right, Mom.  He\\'s here to help.\\n\\n        Sarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers.\\n        Terminator lifts her to her feet.\\n\\n73D     John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the\\n        walls of bars.  John doesn\\'t know what we know, but he knows\\n        something\\'s not right with this guy.  Terminator turns to follow\\n        John\\'s gaze.\\n        The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand, at its side.\\n        Terminator pushes John behind him.  They start backing up.\\n\\n73E     The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars.  It doesn\\'t stop.\\n        Its body divides like jello around the bars.  As it squeezes itself\\n        through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our\\n        side.  We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste\\n        forced past an obstacle.\\n        Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this.\\n        That faint snapping sound is his mind.\\n        There is a CLANK and we see that the guard\\'s gun has caught against\\n        the bars... the only solid object.  The T-1000 turns its wrist and\\n        tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap.\\n\\n73F     Sarah is agape.  Not reacting.  It\\'s been a heavy day for her.\\n        Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto\\n        his back.  John grabs him around the neck.  Terminator raises the\\n        shotgun and starts backing up.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Go!  Run!\\n\\n        Sarah doesn\\'t need to be told twice.\\n        T-1000 walks toward them, opening fire with the Browning Hi-Power.\\n        Terminator straight-arms the 12-guage like a pistol and FIRES.\\n        The stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is\\n        filled with high-velocity lead.  One of them, stupidly running for the\\n        cross-corridor, gets hit by the T-1000.\\n\\n        Terminator is hammered by several slugs, and the T-1000 is cratered\\n        by two buckshots hits.  It staggers, but comes on.  In the craters\\n        we see bright mercury before they close and reseal, disappearing in a\\n        second.\\n\\n73G     Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run.  Ahead,\\n        Sarah is already at the elevator.  Terminator and John pile in and\\n        John slaps the button for \"Garage Level\".\\n\\n        The doors start to close.  T-1000 clears the corner.\\n        Terminator slams John and Sarah back against the side walls as the\\n        T-1000 charges at them, rapid firing the Browning.\\n        The rounds hit the steel doors as they close.\\n        T-1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap.\\n73H     Inside, they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that\\n        are punching holes in the other side.\\n\\n73I     The Browning locks open, empty.  T-1000 drops it without a glance\\n        back.  The doors close.  K-WHAM!  The T-1000 hits them a split second\\n        later.  The elevator hasn\\'t moved yet.  SSWWIKK!\\n\\n73J     A sword-like blade rams through in between the doors, forcing them\\n        open.  Terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap.  Punches\\n        the muzzle right INTO T-1000\\'s face -- BOOM!!\\n73K     We get a glimpse of the T-1000\\'s head blown apart by the blast.  It\\n        is hurtled back.  The doors close.  The car descends.\\n\\n73L     ON THE T-1000, outside the elevator.  Its head, which is blown apart\\n        into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders, reforms quickly.\\n        There is no trace of the injury.  It sees the closed door and jams its\\n        hands between them, its fingertips becoming pry-bars.  It pulls the\\n        doors apart with inhuman strength\\n73M     and LEAPS INTO THE OPEN SHAFT.\\n        It falls two floors and...\\n\\n74      IN THE ELEVATOR.  Out trio hears a loud THUMP on the roof.\\n        Terminator, reloading the shotgun, looks up.\\n        Sarah grabs the .45 from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling.\\n        BEAT...\\n        Then CLANGG!! a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears\\n        down four feet into the elevator car.\\n        It is inches from Sarah\\'s face.\\n        She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof.\\n        Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again, slashing\\n        Terminator\\'s jacket, and missing John by inches.\\n        Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in\\n        the ceiling.\\n        Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal\\n        shafts slash down again and again.  Sarah yells in pain as one of them\\n        slices open her upper arm.\\n\\n75      The doors open.  Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is wide\\n        enough.\\n        They emerge into the basement.  We see the Harley parked nearby.\\n\\n        Terminator, in a rearguard action, fires another blast through the\\n        ceiling and runs out.  He throws his leg over the Harley, kicks it to\\n        life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the\\n        inner pocket of his jacket.  He throws it to John.  A road flare!?\\n\\n76      In the elevator, the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big\\n        enough to...\\n        Pour itself through.\\n        A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening.  The mass drops\\n        through the hole, down out of frame, then comes back up into frame\\n        as Officer X.\\n\\n        It seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after\\n        doing this king of taffy-pull with itself.  It opens its eyes and\\n        sees --\\n\\n77      TERMINATOR, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring\\n        Harley twenty feet away.  Terminator twists the throttle and pops the\\n        clutch.\\n        The back tire screams on the concrete.  The front wheel lifts off the\\n        ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie.\\n\\n        Terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator.\\n        The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right through the\\n        back wall of the elevator.\\n        Terminator rolls to his feet.\\n        Johns strikes the flare on the concrete.  Tosses it.\\n        Terminator catches the life flare with one hand.\\n        Levels the shotgun with the other.\\n        With his last round he blows a big hole in the bike\\'s gas tank.\\n        Gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling T-1000.\\n        Terminator tosses the flare.  KA-VOOOM!\\n\\n        The explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him\\n        in the fireball.  He gets up, smoking, and runs after John and Sarah\\n        toward the exit ramp.\\n\\n78      AT THE EXIT RAMP.  They are partway up when a blue-and-white hospital\\n        security car comes screeching down the other way.\\n        Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car.  It skids to a\\n        shrieking halt.  She\\'s in the guy\\'s face with the .45 in both hands.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                Out of the car!!\\n\\n        The patrol guy is thinking what he can try when BLAM! she puts a round\\n        through the glass next to his head.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                RIGHT NOW!\\n\\n        The door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as\\n        Terminator arrives.  The cyborg flings the rent-a-cop out of the way\\n        and slides behind the wheel.  Sarah gets John into the back seat and\\n        dives into the front passenger seat as --\\n\\n78A     Terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it, lighting up the\\n        tires on the slick ramp.\\n        Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and tells him\\n        to reload.  John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket\\n        and starts feeding them in.\\n        Terminator power backward up the ramp, scraping along one wall, barely\\n        in control.  Because...\\n\\n79      The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below.\\n        This guy won\\'t quit.  Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as it\\n        runs.\\n        It sprints up the ramp after the retreating car.  T-1000 is gaining.\\n\\n80      Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the .45.  She snatches\\n        it, drops the other out, and slaps in the new one.  Cocks the slide.\\n        The car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate.\\n        John hands the shot gun back to Terminator.\\n        He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer.\\n        The T-1000\\'s face is right in the headlights.\\n80A     Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder.  Shiny liquid metal\\n        visible in the hole, which then closes.\\n80B     Sarah, half out the passenger window, opens fire.\\n        The car crashes backward through the security barricade.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                        (calmly)\\n                Hang on.\\n\\n        He cuts the wheel hard.  The car slews into a reverse 180, swapping\\n        ends with a screech.\\n        T-1000 is almost on them.\\n        Terminator punches it.  The car accelerates forward.\\n\\n80C     T-1000 leaps.  Lands on the trunk.\\n        Its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid.\\n        Feet dragging on the pavement, it slams its other hand down,\\n        punching another metal hook into the trunk lid, pulling itself up.\\n        Terminator turns to Sarah.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Drive.\\n\\n        Terminator heaves himself half out the driver\\'s window.  Sarah slaps\\n        her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side.\\n\\n80D     T-1000, fully on the car now, holds on with one hook-hand while it\\n        slams the other into the back window, sweeping away the glass and\\n        missing John by inches as he ducks.\\n        It draws back for another swing, lunging forward as --\\n\\n80E     Terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car.\\n        Fires point-blank.\\n        Hits the T-1000\\'s arm just above the \"hand\" which anchors it to the\\n        car.  The 12-guage blows the arm apart, severing the hook-hand.\\n\\n80F     T-1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car.\\n        John looks out the back window, his eyes wide.\\n        He sees the T-1000 roll to his feet and continue running.\\n        But he\\'s dropping way behind now.  Sarah has the car floored and the\\n        liquid-metal killer won\\'t catch them on foot.\\n\\n80G     John watches, in awe, as the \"crowbar hand\", stuck into the trunk\\n        right in front of him, reverts to the neutral polyalloy... a kind of\\n        think mercury.  The gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and\\n        falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob.\\n\\n80H     The car speeds off into the night.\\n        REVERSE on the T-1000, walking now, coming right up into closeup,\\n        watching the tail lights recede.  It looks down.\\n\\n80I     ANGLE ON BLACKTOP, tight on the liquid metal blob.  Next to it is the\\n        T-1000\\'s shiny cop shoe.

On a Sunday morning,\\n        when most men are relaxing, spending time with their families, Dyson\\n        is hard at work.\\n\\n        IN A PROFILE CLOSEUP we see him in deep concentration, his mind\\n        prowling the labyrinth of his new microprocessor.\\n\\n        A WOMAN\\'S FACE ENTERS FRAME soundlessly behind him.

He smiles and turns to kiss her good morning.\\n        She\\'s still in her bathrobe, holding coffee.

Then he\\n        puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her gently.

In one smooth motion, Terminator cuts all the way\\n        around his arm.  With a second cut, he splits the skin of the forearm\\n        from elbow to wrist.\\n\\n        TERMINATOR grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a\\n        surgeon rips off a rubber glove.  It comes off with a sucking rip,\\n        leaving a bloody skeleton.\\n\\n        But the skeleton is made of bright metal, and is laced with hydraulic\\n        actuators.  The fingers are as finely crafted as watch parts... they\\n        flex into a fist and extend.  Terminator holds it up, palm out, in\\n        almost the exact position of the one in the vault at Cyberdyne,\\n\\n        HOLD ON DYSON reacting to the servo-hand in front of him.\\n        He\\'s seen one of these before.\\n        Tarissa is screaming now, but he doesn\\'t hear her.\\n\\n                                DYSON\\n                My God.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Now listen to me very carefully.\\n\\n137     INT.

His\\n        shoulder is bandaged.  Terminator\\'s arm is wrapped with a blood-soaked\\n        bandage below the elbow.  The steel forearm and hand gleam in the\\n        harsh kitchen light.

Unprotected officers run, choking\\n        and half-blind, slamming into cars and tripping over each other.  It\\n        is a total rout.\\n\\n175     AT THE SWAT VAN on of the SWATs is rapidly handing out the remaining\\n        masks to unprotected cops.  A FIGURE appears out of the smoke beside\\n        him.  He looks up.  His mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty\\n        launcher.  Instinctively he catches it.  Terminator grabs his flak\\n        vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist.\\n\\n175A    INT. SWAT VAN\\n\\n        Terminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the driver\\'s\\n        seat.  No keys in the ignition.  He flips down the sun visor.  The\\n        keys fall into his hand.  He starts the van and slams it into gear.\\n\\n176     INT./EXT. LOBBY\\n\\n        The tear gas has cleared to a thin haze.  The uninjured SWATs are\\n        tending their wounded.  They look up at the sound of shouts and a\\n        roaring engine.\\n\\n176A    THE SWAT VAN CRASHES INTO THE LOBBY in an explosion of glass and\\n        debris.  Cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a \\n        smoking one-eighty, sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads\\n        to the bank of elevators.  Terminator backs up until -- crunch -- he\\n        seals the corridor with the back of the van.\\n\\n176B    Sarah and John stumble along the corridor, coughing.\\n        They leap into the back of the van and Terminator hits the throttle.\\n        The van roars across the lobby and exits through blown-out windows.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n177     INT./EXT SECOND FLOOR\\n\\n        T-1000, astride the Kawasaki, looks down from a second-floor office\\n        and sees the van tearing across the parking lot with the remaining\\n        cops firing at it.  It knows.  It looks around.  Analyzing options.\\n        It sees the helicopter hovering outside the building at the end of\\n        this corner office block...\\n        It twists full throttle on the powerful bike.\\n        Roars through the office, accelerating fast, straight at the\\n        windows --\\n\\n178     T-1000 BLASTS OUT THROUGH THE GLASS, airborne on the motorcycle.  It\\n        rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and --\\n178A    SLAMS into the canopy.  The impact of bike and rider pitches the\\n        chopper radically.  The startled PILOT fights to regain control as the\\n        bike tumbles to the pavement below.\\n178B    The T-1000 doesn\\'t.  It clings to the shattered canopy.\\n        Nightmarishly, the pilot watches as the T-1000 smashes its head\\n        through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly POURS ITSELF through the\\n        jagged hole.  It reforms instantly into its previous self on the\\n        passenger seat.\\n\\n178C    It hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the driver\\'s\\n        seat.\\n        The chopper is auto-rotating, spinning out of control.  It drops\\n        toward the parking lot.  T-1000 recovers control ten feet above the\\n        ground.\\n\\n178D    Cops hits the deck as the tail-boom swings around, going over them by\\n        inches.\\n        The chopper lifts out in a power climb, roaring away across the\\n        parking lot toward the fleeing SWAT van.\\n\\n        OKAY, BUCKLE YOUR SEATBELTS, HERE IT COMES...\\n\\n179     INT./EXT. SWAT VAN/HIGHWAY - NIGHT\\n\\n        Terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van\\n        onto a divided highway.  Sarah and John are catching their breath,\\n        still coughing from the CS gas.  Terminator look to the rear-view\\n        mirror.  He sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them,\\n        gaining.\\n\\n        Sarah looks around the inside of the SWAT van.  It is a rolling\\n        armory.  There are rifles, ballistic vests, all manner of equipment.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                John, get under these.  Hurry!\\n\\n        He sits against the front bulkhead of the van and she pile bullet-\\n        proof vests on top of him, completely covering him.  Then she grabs\\n        two M-16s from the wall-rack and loads them.  She starts on a shotgun\\n        as --\\n\\n180     The SWAT van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed.\\n        Terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to\\n        be crawling.  The van hits it top speed of eighty.  They swerve to\\n        miss the back end of A WHITE 18-WHEEL TANKER.\\n180A    The chopper swings in behind them, closing fast.\\n180B    T-1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the MPK machine\\n        pistol and FIRES.  The back of the can CLANGS WITH HITS.  The door\\n        windows are BLOWN IN.\\n\\n        Terminator weaves the van, trying to throw off the T-1000\\'s aim.\\n        The unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control.\\n        One of the doors is kicked open.  Sarah, wearing a ballistic vest,\\n        crouches in the doorway, whipping up the M-16.  SHE OPENS FIRE.\\n\\n180C    Bullets riddle what\\'s left of the chopper\\'s canopy as the T-1000\\n        returns fire.\\n        The van is stitched with hits.\\n\\n180D    INSIDE THE VAN holes are punched through the thin sheet-metal walls,\\n        ripping up the interior.  The vests covering John are hit repeatedly.\\n        We see that Sarah has hung two Kevlar vests on the inside of the back\\n        door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her.  She pops\\n        back out and fires in controlled bursts.  The M-16 empties and she\\n        grabs another.\\n\\n180E    Terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes, hitting it\\n        and knocking it skidding.\\n\\n181     OMITTED\\n\\n181A    Sarah reloads and keeps firing.  The van swerves around a Toyota.  A\\n        moment later the helicopter passes it, the rotor just clearing the top\\n        of the car.\\n\\n181B    T-1000 FIRES the machine pistol.\\n181C    Sarah has popped out to fire.  She takes a HIT in the thigh, and\\n        several rounds hammer into her Kevlar vest.  She is thrown back onto\\n        the floor of the van.  She lies there, an exposed target...\\n\\n181D    Terminator sees the T-1000 preparing to fire again.\\n        He locks up the van\\'s brakes.  Tires scream as the vehicle shimmies.\\n        Sarah is thrown forward, sliding up to the bulkhead next to John.\\n182     And the helicopter SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.\\n        The rotor disintegrates.  The back doors of the van are crushed in as\\n        the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK,\\n        trapping the T-1000 inside the twisted metal.  The chopper hits the\\n        pavement, flips, sideways, and cartwheels... smashing itself into a\\n        shapeless mass of twisted metal.\\n        It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end.\\n\\n182A    Terminator fights to control the van, which is fishtailing violently\\n        from the impact.  It smashes up against the center divider, screeching\\n        along the concrete, and then pulls away.  Terminator puts the hammer\\n        down and the van accelerates.  He swerves to avoid an UGLY PICKUP\\n        crawling like a snail ahead.\\n\\n        THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER of the van, crumpled by slamming the wall, is\\n        sawing into the tire.  The tire blows and peels off the clean rim.\\n        The steel wheel grinds across the pavement, striking trails of sparks,\\n        and the van slides sideways and topples --\\n        STEEL SCREAMS on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on its side.\\n\\n182B    INSIDE THE VAN, John crawls to Sarah, who is groaning and holding her\\n        bleeding leg.  She is white and shocky.  Terminator starts to\\n        extricate himself from the crumpled driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n183     BACK DOWN THE ROAD, THE HELICOPTER wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk\\n        metal, unrecognizable.  Behind it, the TANKER TRUCK brakes hard, \\n        shuddering and groaning, trying to stop.  The big tires lock up in\\n        clouds of tire-smoke.  The rig comes to a shuddering stop just short\\n        of the wrecked chopper.\\n\\n183A    The shaken DRIVER jumps down.\\n        The behind the wreckage a cop emerges, walking toward him.\\n\\n                                DRIVER\\n                Goddamn, are you alri --\\n\\n183B    SSSHHCK!  T-1000 drives a blade through the man\\'s abdomen and walks\\n        on past without slowing, or even looking at him.\\n\\n183C    It climbs into the open cab of the tanker.  Releases the brake.\\n        As the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters\\n        on the side which say \"CRYOCO INC.  LIQUID NITROGEN SUPPLY\\'.\\n\\n184     AT THE SWAT VAN John and Terminator are carrying Sarah out of the\\n        wreck.  Terminator has the M-79 slung over his shoulder, the\\n        bandolier of grenades, and his .45 stuck in his waistband.  John has\\n        borrowed a 12-GAUGE RIOT GUN from the SWATs.\\n\\n184A    The pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them.  The DRIVER,\\n        A Hispanic guy in his 50\\'s, is getting out to help them.  Terminator\\n        and John hear a CRASH and look back as the\\n185     helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck.\\n\\n186                             JOHN\\n                Holy shit.  Come on, Mom... we gotta keep\\n                moving... come on --\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                        (to the pickup owner)\\n                We need your truck.\\n\\n        The guy seems to know better than to try and stop him as Terminator\\n        slides Sarah into the front seat and climbs in behind the wheel.  John\\n        runs to the passenger side.\\n\\n187     THE TANKER ROARS, spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts\\n        up through the gears.\\n\\n188     Terminator slams the pickup in gear, checking the rear-view.  The\\n        tanker is a hundred feet behind them now, and really moving.\\n        Terminator puts the throttle down, but the pickup is and old slug\\n        loaded down by a heavy home-made wooden camper-shell.  It accelerates\\n        slowly.\\n\\n189     THE TANKER slams into one end of the SWAT van, spinning it out of the\\n        way with a roar and screech of twisting metal.  The 18-wheeler shifts\\n        to a higher gear, still accelerating.\\n\\n190     INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK\\n\\n        With the tanker right behind them, Terminator cuts the wheel, swerving\\n        the pickup back and forth across the lanes.\\n        The big rig stays right on them, it tanker whiplashing violently.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Faster!  He\\'s right on us!\\n\\n        Terminator doesn\\'t reply.  He rapidly unslings the blooper, still\\n        around his neck, and reaches for a grenade.\\n\\n191     LOW ANGLE ON THE TRACTOR-TRAILER as it roars right up to the lens,\\n        filling frame with chrome and lights.\\n\\n191A    K-WHAM!!  It rams the backs of the pickup, sending it skidding.\\n\\n191B    Then the T-1000 pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and\\n        crabs over, sandwiching it against the center divider.  The spinning\\n        chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail\\n        screeches along the other side.\\n\\n        The pickup bucks and shakes insanely.  It ricochets violently between\\n        the big-rig and the divider\\n        Horrible SCREECH of tortured steel.\\n        Sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides.\\n        The windshield shatters as the door-posts buckle in.\\n        Metal and glass shower in through the side windows.\\n        The frame twists and buckles.  John feels like the fillings are being\\n        shaken right out of his teeth.\\n        The wooden camper disintegrates, falling away as kindling behind\\n        them.\\n\\n191C    INT. TANKER CAB\\n\\n        T-1000 holds the wheel hard over, mercilessly grinding the pickup.\\n        The whole rig jerks and shakes with the violence of the sustained\\n        hammering.\\n\\n191D    INT./EXT. PICKUP\\n\\n        Terminator slides toward the passenger side.  Keeping his foot on the\\n        gas he lifts John over him and puts him in the driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Drive for a minute.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Where you going?!\\n\\n        Terminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand.\\n        Held together by the plastic laminate, the windshield flops out of its\\n        frame.  It flies over the top of the truck.\\n\\n191E    Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up.\\n        He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed.\\n191F    POOM!  The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.  It EXPLODES\\n        against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top.  Liquid\\n        nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream.\\n\\n191G    The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control.  The tanker swings like\\n        a pendulum behind the cab.\\n\\n191H    The pickup accelerates, getting back out in front by a few yards.\\n        Behind it the big-rig is trailing a swirling comet-tail of nitrogen\\n        vapor.  It is gaining again.\\n\\n        Terminator, still standing, opens the breech and starts to reload.\\n191I    John cuts across the highway and takes an OFF RAMP.\\n\\n191J    T-1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the\\n        ramp after him, still accelerating.  It is twenty feet behind them\\n        and closing when Terminator closes the breech and FIRES.\\n\\n191K    The grenade hits the front grill and EXPLODES.\\n        The radiator is destroyed, along with half the hood.  Steam blasts\\n        out, obscuring the whole front of the truck.\\n\\n191L    The semi rams the back of the pickup again.  Spewing smoke and vapor\\n        like some demon locomotive, the tractor-trailer pounds into the back\\n        of the pickup.  Driving it right through the intersection at the\\n        bottom of the ramp, and straight toward --\\n\\n        EXT. STEEL MILL\\n\\n        The chase has led them to an area of heavy industry.\\n\\n192     THE GATES are blasted off their hinges as the semi rams the pickup\\n        right through them.  Terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos\\n        and impacts.  He has THREE GRENADES LEFT on the bandolier.\\n\\n        John isn\\'t even steering.  They are just being pushed.  There\\'s\\n        nothing he can do.  They are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare\\n        which leads directly to the MAIN BUILDING of the plant.\\n\\n192A    Terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup.\\n        He leaps to the bed, takes two powerful strides and --\\n        Leaps onto the semi.  He climbs rapidly onto the hood.\\n192B    And FIRES POINT BLANK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.\\n        Right into T-1000\\'s face.\\n        The EXPLOSION blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke\\n        and fire  Terminator grabs onto the air-horn as the truck starts to\\n        SHUDDER AND\\n192C    SCREAM.  IT IS JACK-KNIFING.\\n        Almost dream-slow the cab begins to swing sideways, until its tires\\n        are shrieking over the pavement.  The tractor is smashed back at\\n        right-angles to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside.\\n\\n192D    The juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways\\n        across the pavement.\\n        It begins to topple.\\n        Terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top.\\n        With an unholy scream, like the unoiled hubs of Hell, the whole rig\\n        slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill.  A sheet of sparks\\n        sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement.\\n\\n192E    John sees what\\'s behind him, then snaps around to see the building\\n        looming right in front.

STEEL MILL/MAIN AISLE\\n\\n        Terminator slams to the floor of the mill and rolls, as --\\n        The tanker-trailer smashed into a massive concrete support at one side\\n        of the doors.  Thunderous carnage of twisting metal.              o\\n193A    It splits wide open.  A river of liquid nitrogen pours out at -230.\\n\\n193B    John hits the brakes, sliding out of control.  He slows almost to a\\n        stop but hits a steel support column head-on.  He and Sarah are\\n        slammed forward, hard.\\n\\n193C    Terminator, still clutching the M-79 blooper, rolls and slides across\\n        the floor.\\n        He smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a\\n        massive machine.\\n\\n193D    The semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage, into the building, and\\n        shudders to a stop.  Liquid nitrogen sprays over the cab, flooding out\\n        around it in a HISSING WAVEFRONT OF ULTRACOLD.\\n        Freezing vapor swirls everywhere, obscuring the wreck.\\n\\n193E    TERMINATOR lies still.  A beat.  Then he rolls weakly, rising on one\\n        elbow to survey the scene.\\n\\n193F    IN THE WRECKED PICKUP, John stirs.  He is stunned, and blood runs from\\n        his nose.  Dazed, he realizes he is in a steel mill.  There are\\n        sirens, and he can see men running... shouting.  He turns and sees\\n        what they are running from...\\n\\n193G    The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker.  It is\\n        a strange vista of fire and ice.  The huge SMELTERS pour out orange\\n        light and fire from the sides of the huge galley, while the freezing\\n        vapor rolls down the center.\\n\\n193H    TIGHT ON THE WRECK.  A billowing gray cloud.  Deep inside, the shape\\n        of the cab in visible.  A FIGURE emerges, pulling itself out.  It\\n        drops to the floor.  The hissing, boiling river of liquid nitrogen\\n        flows around its feet.\\n\\n194     The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully.  It has finally been\\n        affected by something.  Its feet are freezing to the ground as it\\n        walks...\\n\\n194A    CLINK!  One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle.  It stumbles\\n        forward, and --\\n194B    Its other foot snaps off.  As it catches its balance on the stump of\\n        its other ankle,\\n194C    the whole lower leg shatters at the impact.  It topples forward to its\\n        knees.\\n        Catches itself on one hand.  Liquid nitrogen flows around the hand.\\n\\n        Now the hand is stuck to the pavement.\\n194D    The T-1000 pulls and... CLINK!  The hand snaps off at the wrist.\\n        It looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist.  For the first time\\n        we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one...\\n        The expression is pain.  Agony.  Its mouth opens in a soundless\\n        scream as the hoar-frost races up its legs, across its body.\\n194E    And that\\'s the position it freezes in.\\n        It has become a statue, kneeling in the frozen vapor, that surprised\\n        look of agony frozen on its face.\\n\\n        The liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate.\\n194F    Terminator, just beyond the boundary of the cold, can see the T-1000\\n        clearly.\\n        He draws his .45 and aims.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Hasta la vista, baby.\\n\\n194G    K-POW!  The single shot blows the T-1000 into a million diamonds\\n        spraying up into the air.  They shimmer across the ground for twenty\\n        feet in all directions.\\n        Terminator lowers the gun, satisfied.\\n        He looks like he needs a vacation.\\n\\n195     JOHN AND SARAH have seen it from the pickup.

On his knees, he looks into the dissipating cloud of\\n        vapor.  The heat of the furnaces has evaporated all the liquid\\n        nitrogen.\\n\\n196     INSERT, TIGHT ON THE FLOOR - the T-1000 shards are melting,\\n        liquefying.

He looks back.\\n\\n203     INT, MAIN GALLERY\\n\\n        The T-1000 steps INTO FRAME.  Fully formed.  The hell-fire light\\n        glints on its impassive cop face.  It walks forward.  At first it\\n        seems unaffected by its crystallization but --\\n\\n203A    ANGLE ON ITS HAND as it touches a railing in passing.  The railing is\\n        covered with O.S.H.A. yellow-and-black safety tape.\\n        The hand turns yellow and black, the color fading to normal by about\\n        the elbow.  It rips the hand from the railing with difficulty.  There\\n        is a sound like adhesive tape ripping off a surface.\\n\\n203B    The T-1000 looks at its yellow-and-black striped hand.  It wills the\\n        hand back to normal.  We see ripples of \"static\" or system noise\\n        moving subtly over the surface of its body.  It\\'s starting to\\n        \"glitch\".\\n\\n203C    TRACKING WITH THE T-1000\\'S FEET.  With each step, the pattern on the\\n        tile floor \"invades\" its lower legs.  Fades as the foot is lifted.\\n        Returns as it is set down.  The foot is trying to meld with the floor.\\n        The chameleonic function is out of control.\\n        The T-1000 is losing it.  It moves forward, searching.  It rounds the\\n        corner, entering the aisle between the furnaces.\\n\\n204     INT.

It clatters to the floor.\\n\\n        The grenade spins across the floor, rolling under some machinery.\\n        Terminator lunges, slamming the T-1000 against a wall with all his\\n        weight.  The battle is joined.\\n\\n204B    JOHN AND SARAH have reached the back of the aisle.  It is a cul-de-\\n        sac, blocked on the end by the base of an IMMENSE SMELTER CRUCIBLE.\\n        They turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette, backlit by the\\n        molten sparks falling from the furnaces above.  The battle which will\\n        decide their fate.\\n\\n204C    Terminator grabs the T-1000 and hurls it with awesome force against\\n        the opposite wall of the narrow alley.  In less time than it would\\n        take to turn, the\\n204D    T-1000 morphs trough itself, front to back... face emerging from the\\n        back of its head.\\n204E    It comes off the wall straight at Terminator, who smashes his good\\n        fist into its face.  The pile-driver blow buries Terminator\\'s fist\\n        almost to the elbow.\\n\\n204F    But the T-1000\\'s head morphs in a split-second into a hand which grips\\n        Terminator\\'s wrist, and the head \"emerges\" somewhere else, the\\n        geometry shifting faster than we can follow.\\n204G    The T-1000 slams Terminator into a large machine, jamming his arm into\\n        the moving works.  A massive sliding bar SCISSORS HIS ARM, smashing it\\n        into junk at the elbow, pinning him in the machine.\\n\\n        Terminator strains against the machine pinning him.  We hear his\\n        servos whining with overload.  The T-1000 turns and lopes toward Sarah\\n        and John.\\n\\n        Sarah screams and hurls John into a gap between the machines.  He\\n        falls into a maze of pipes and girders.\\n\\n205     INT. MAZE OF MACHINES\\n\\n        JOHN turns to see her in the entrance of the narrow gap.  She could\\n        follow him but she doesn\\'t.  SUDDENLY a dark mass moves toward him.\\n        John gasps as a huge steel counterweight, driven by a chain 6 inches\\n        thick, slides toward him.  He rolls out of the way.  When he looks\\n        back, he cannot see the opening.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Mom!  MOMMM!!\\n\\n206     INT. AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES\\n\\n        TERMINATOR strains to reach a 6-foot steel bar lying near him.  Steel\\n        workers use them to move the red-hot ingots around.  He gets hold of\\n        the end and uses it as a lever.  With titanic effort he spreads the\\n        massive components which are holding him, and withdraws him arm, which\\n        is severed at the elbow.  Dangling junk hands from the crushed joint.\\n\\n207     SARAH has lost sight of John.  It is much of a goodbye as they will\\n        have.\\n        She turns as the T-1000 closes on her.  She is half-slumped against\\n        the sooty machines, looking barely conscious.  She struggles to load\\n        a shell into the empty weapon.  At the last instant she whips up the\\n        RIOT GUN and FIRES.\\n\\nA207    T-1000\\'s face is blown open, but quickly reforms as it closes on her.\\n        She fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but --\\nA208    THUNK!  A steel needle slams through her shoulder, pinning her.\\n        The polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand.  The index finger\\n        extends as a gleaming needle, toward her eye --\\n\\n                                T-1000\\n                Call to John.  Now.\\n\\n207C    WHAM!!  SOMETHING whistles down on the T-1000 with such force that is\\n        cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval.  The 6-foot steel\\n        bar is imbedded in its body.  Terminator hurls the killer off Sarah.\\n\\n207D    The T-1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with\\n        fury.\\n        Swinging again and again.  Hammering Terminator back.  Terminator\\n        falls back against the wall.\\n\\n        Behind the T-1000 is an enormous I-beam, hanging from two chains.  It\\n        is used to lift ingots into the smelters, and it runs on a linear\\n        track.\\n207E    The T-1000 grabs the I-beam and rolls it down the track.  Straight at\\n        Terminator.  The two-ton girder smashes into his chest, crushing the\\n        armor.\\n        The T-1000 pulls the I-beam back, and then heaves it forward again.\\n        Terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder.  We hear\\n        metal crush and break inside him.  He sags, turning to grip the\\n        wall...\\n        The third blow slams into his back, smashing his spine and pelvis.  We\\n        hear servos ratcheting and failing.  He drops to his knees, crucified\\n        on a wall of machinery.\\n        The fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades.  Sound of\\n        crushing metal.  His skull is partially caved in.\\n        He slides to the floor.\\n\\n207F    ON THE T-1000, emotionless as it walks forward.\\n\\n207G    TERMINATOR is a pathetic shape on the floor.  He is trying to crawl,\\n        feebly.\\n        Dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine.  His arm\\n        stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward.  His\\n        exposed machine eye burns red with determination.\\n\\n        We see his prize.  He has the M-79, with the breech still open, \\n        cradled in the crook of his ruined arm.  He good hand, the exposed\\n        steel one, is reaching for the last grenade, which is visible under\\n        the skirt of the massive smelter base.  His metal fingers reach out\\n        for it as --\\n\\n207H    The T-1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down\\n        with unbelievable force.  It punches into Terminator\\'s back, through a\\n        gap in the shattered armor.  The T-1000 levers it back and forth,\\n        widening the hole.  Then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it\\n        down.\\n        It punches right through.  Emerging from Terminator\\'s chest.\\n        And into the floor.  He is pinioned.  The cyborg sags face down and\\n        stop moving.  The light goes out of his eye.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n208     INT.

It staggers again.\\n        K-CHAK.  BOOM!  And again.  And again.\\n\\n209C    The T-1000 is blown back a step and Sarah advances with each shot.\\n        The craters in the T-1000\\'s body \"heal\" slowly.  Its power is waning.\\n        She FIRES again.  And again.  Her eyes blazing with feral intensity.\\n        She walks it back, right to the edge of the pit of MOLTEN STEEL.\\n\\n        K-CHAK... CLICK.  She\\'s empty.  The T-1000 is right at the edge.  In a\\n        second it will recover its composure, as its crater hits close slowly.\\n        She has failed.

The grenade EXPLODES inside\\n        its body.  A huge hole is blown clean through it, and it is ripped\\n        open and peeled back, half inside-out.  It topples into the molten\\n        steel and --\\n\\n211     The T-1000\\'s head and upper body reappear above the molten steel.\\n        It is screaming.

The world has aged her, but she seems\\n        at peace in this moment.  She speaks into a microcassette recorder.\\n\\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\\n                That was thirty years ago.  But the dark future\\n                which never came still exists for me, and it\\n                always will, like the traces of a dream lingering\\n                in the morning light.  And the war against the\\n                machines goes on.  Or, to be more precise, the\\n                war against those who build the wrong machines.\\n\\n        There is a man in is forties playing with two small children\\n        nearby.  He turns.  It is John Connor.  Through he has the same stern\\n        features in adulthood, there is no eye-patch, no scarring.  He is far\\n        from the haggard man on grim destiny we saw in the world that might\\n        have been.  But there is still penetrating intelligence, even wisdom,\\n        in his eyes.\\n\\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\\n                John fights the war differently than it was\\n                foretold.  Here, on the battlefield of the\\n                Senate, the weapons are common sense... and\\n                hope.\\n\\n        A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL runs to her to have her shoelace tied.\\n\\n                                GIRL\\n                Tie me, grandma.\\n\\n        Grandma Sarah smiles.  It is the only time we have seen her smile so\\n        far.  She bends as the little girls puts her foot up on the bench.\\n        She ties as we hear:\\n\\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\\n                The luxury of hope was given to me by the\\n                Terminator.  Because if a machine can learn\\n                the value of human life... maybe we can too.\\n\\n        Sarah ruffles the kids\\'s hair as she runs off to play with her dad.\\n\\n                                                FADE OUT\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n                                MARIO KASSAR\\n                                  PRESENTS\\n\\n                                     A\\n                               PACIFIC WESTERN\\n                                 PRODUCTION\\n\\n                            IN ASSOCIATION WITH\\n                          LIGHTSTORM ENTERTAINMENT\\n\\n                                     A\\n                               JAMES CAMERON\\n                                    FILM\\n\\n                                   ARNOLD\\n                               SCHWARZENEGGER\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR 2\\n                                JUDGMENT DAY\\n\\n                               LINDA HAMILTON\\n\\n                               ROBERT PATRICK\\n\\n                                 JOE MORTON\\n\\n                                 EARL BOEN\\n                            S.

In SLOW MOTION\\n        they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed bumper to\\n        bumper.  Heat ripples distort the torrent of faces.  The image is\\n        surreal, dreamy... and like a dream it begins very slowly to\\n\\n                                                DISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n2       EXT. CITY RUINS - NIGHT\\n\\n        Same spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell.  The\\n        cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper.  The\\n        skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some\\n        unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles.\\n        Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten\\n        million dead souls.  It scurries the ashes into drifts, stark\\n        white in the moonlight against the charred rubble.\\n        A TITLE CARD FADES IN:\\n\\n                        LOS ANGELES, July 11, 2029\\n\\n3       ANGLE ON a heap of fire-blackened human bones.  Beyond the mound is a\\n        vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete.  The rush hour crowd\\n        burned down in their tracks.\\n\\n4       WE DISSOLVE TO a playground... where intense heat has half-melted the\\n        jungle gym, the blast has warped the swing set, the merry-go-round\\n        has sagged in the firestorm.  Small skulls look accusingly from the\\n        ash-drifts.  WE HEAR the distant echo of children\\'s voices... playing\\n        and laughing in the sun.  A silly, sing-songy rhyme as WE TRACKS\\n        SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch\\n        lines are still visible.\\n\\n        CAMERA comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle... next to the\\n        tiny skull of its owner.  HOLD ON THIS IMAGE as a female VOICE speaks:\\n\\n                                VOICE\\n                3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997.\\n                The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war\\n                Judgment Day.  They lived only to face a new\\n                nightmare, the war against the Machines...\\n\\n        A metal foot crushes the skull like china.\\n\\n        TILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle.\\n        It looks like a CHROME SKELETON... a high-tech Death figure.  It is\\n        the endoskeleton of a Series 800 terminator.  Its glowing red eyes\\n        compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain, hunting.\\n\\n        The SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES.  Searchlights blaze down as a\\n        formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes\\n        overhead.  PAN WITH THEM toward the jagged horizon, beyond which we\\n        see flashes, and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in\\n        progress.\\n\\n5       EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT\\n\\n        THE BATTLE.  Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for\\n        possession of the dead Earth.  The humans are a ragtag guerrilla\\n        army.  Skynet\\'s weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot\\n        gun-platforms), flying Aerial HKs, four-legged gun-pods called\\n        Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms.\\n\\n        SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS:\\n5A      Explosions!  Beam-weapons firing like searing strobe-light.\\n5B      A gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a LAW rocket at a\\n        pursuing Aerial HK, bringing it down in a fiery explosion.\\n5C      Another APC is crushed under the treads of a massive Ground HK.\\n\\n5D      A TEAM OF GUERRILLAS in a intense fire-fight with terminator\\n5E      endoskeletons in the ruins of a building.  Three terminator\\n5F      endoskeletons advance, firing rapidly.  Another (complete cyborg),\\n        with flesh ripped open and back broken, gropes for a rifle on the\\n        ground.\\n\\n5G      A Centurion overruns a human firing position.  Soldiers are cut\\n        down as they run.  Fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing\\n        machines.\\n\\n6       IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle, a man watches\\n        the combat with night-vision binoculars.  He wears the uniform of a\\n        guerrilla general, and a black beret.  He is still amid running,\\n        shouting techs and officers.\\n\\n        C.U. MAN, pushing slowly in as the battle rages O.S.  He lowers the\\n        binoculars.  He is forty-five years old.  Features severe.  The left\\n        side of his face is heavily scarred.  A patch covers that eye.  An\\n        impressive man, forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war.  The name\\n        stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR.  We push in until his\\n        eyes fill frame, then...\\n\\n                                                DISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n        FIRE.  SLOW, BOILING, ENORMOUS.  FILLING FRAME.\\n\\n                                VOICE (SARAH CONNOR)\\n                Skynet, the computer which controlled the machines,\\n                sent two terminators back through time.  Their\\n                mission: to destroy the leader of the human\\n                Resistance... John Connor.  My son.\\n\\n                The first terminator was programmed to strike at\\n                me, in the year 1984... before John was born.\\n                It failed.\\n\\n                The second was set to strike at John himself,\\n                when he was still a child.  As before, the\\n                Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.  A\\n                protector for John.

TRUCKSTOP - NIGHT\\n\\n        Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon\\n        formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot\\n        of an all-night truck stop.  Then...\\n\\n        The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in\\n        the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.\\n        Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!\\n\\n        Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man.\\n        TERMINATOR has come through.  Physique: massive, perfect.  Face:\\n        devoid of emotion.  Terminator stands and impassively surveys its\\n        surroundings.\\n\\n8       INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT\\n\\n        On a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over\\n        chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are\\n        playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the\\n        table\\'s rail.  The dive\\'s owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a\\n        soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on...\\n\\n        Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that\\n        doesn\\'t happen every night.  All eyes simultaneously swivel toward\\n        Terminator.  Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it\\n        walks calmly through the room.  Everyone frozen, not sure how to\\n        react.\\n\\n8A      TERMINATOR POV.  A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid\\n        with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye\\n        can follow.  In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the\\n        owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking\\n        biker puffing on a cigar.  His body is outlined, or \"selected\", and\\n        thousands of estimated measurements appear.  His clothing has been\\n        analyzed and deemed suitable...\\n\\n8B                              TERMINATOR\\n                I need your clothes, your boots, and your\\n                motorcycle.\\n\\n        The big biker\\'s eyes narrow.  He takes a long draw on this cigar,\\n        the tip cherry-red hot.\\n\\n                                CIGAR BIKER\\n                You forgot to say please.\\n\\n        He grinds the cigar out on Terminator\\'s chest.  Which produces not\\n        the slight reaction of pain.  Terminator calmly, and without\\n        expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm...\\n        Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.\\n\\n        Terminator doesn\\'t see Cigar\\'s friend, behind him, holding his pool\\n        cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.  The heavy send\\n        whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of\\n        Terminator\\'s head.\\n\\n        Terminator seems not to notice.  Doesn\\'t even blink.  Without\\n        releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs\\n        Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.  Suddenly the heavyset biker\\n        finds himself flying through the nearest window.  CRAASSH!\\n\\n        Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar,\\n        through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the\\n        big flat GRILL.  We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar\\n        screams, flopping jerking.  He rolls off in a smoking heap.\\n\\n        The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes\\n        at Terminator\\'s face.\\n\\n        Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.  Holding it by\\n        the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy\\'s hand.\\n        Ultra-fast here: He flips it.  Grabs the handle like you\\'re supposed\\n        to hold a knife.  Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the\\n        bar.  Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker\\'s\\n        shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.\\n\\n9       INT. KITCHEN\\n\\n        The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in.\\n        The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar,\\n        who is cursing in pain on the floor.\\n\\n        With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto\\n        tucked under his leather jacket.  But he can\\'t even hold onto it.\\n        Terminator takes it from him.  Instead of pointing it at him,\\n        Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and\\n        operating condition.  Terminator never threatens... that\\'s a human\\n        thing.  He just takes.\\n\\n        Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to\\n        him.  He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator\\'s\\n        foot.  Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.\\n\\n10      INT. TRUCK STOP\\n\\n        Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black\\n        leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots.  He\\n        moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table.  Without\\n        slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.  The guy slumps to the\\n        floor, groaning, behind him.\\n\\n        Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd,\\n        the owner.  At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit\\n        frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.  One of the truckers finally\\n        nods.\\n\\n                                TRUCKER\\n                Evening...\\n\\n        Terminator impassively stares back.  Then moves on out the door.\\n\\n11      EXT. TRUCK STOP\\n\\n        Terminator walks out, surveying the parked Harleys.  Sticks the .45\\n        in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE.\\n        He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition.  Kicks\\n        over the engine.  It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron\\n        into gear with a KLUNK.\\n\\n        Lloyd appears at the diner\\'s door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE\\n        WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN.  He fires into the air and jacks\\n        around round in fast, aiming at Terminator\\'s back.\\n\\n                                LLOYD\\n                I can\\'t let you take the man\\'s wheels, son.\\n                Now get off or I\\'ll put you down.\\n\\n        Terminator turns and considers by coldly.  He eases the shifter up\\n        into neutral.  Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.  Swings him leg\\n        over and walks calmly toward the guy.\\n\\n        Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the\\n        shotgun\\'s muzzle.  Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he\\'s\\n        going to kill a man in cold blood.  He\\'s still trying to decide when\\n        Terminator\\'s hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow\\n        suddenly holding the shotgun.\\n\\n        Lloyd gapes, knowing he\\'s screwed.  Then...\\n        Terminator reaches toward him.  Oh shit...\\n        And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd\\'s shirt pocket.  Puts them on.\\n        Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.\\n\\n12      EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT\\n\\n        Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A.  Cold neon flares\\n        across the chrome of the big bike.  The 10-gauge is jammed through\\n        the clutch and brake cables, across the handlebars.  The lights flow\\n        over Terminator\\'s wrap-around sunglasses like the tracks of tracer\\n        rounds.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n13      EXT.

BLACK-AND-WHITE cruises the empty street.\\n\\n        A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the columns\\n        of the overpass.  The young UNIFORMED COP in the car whips his head\\n        around at the source of the light.  He pulls over quickly, in time\\n        to see...\\n\\n13A     The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between\\n        the columns.  Lightning climbs the chain-link fence and light\\n        standards, lighting up the night, and papers swirl in a blasting\\n        whirlwind.\\n\\n13B     The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades.\\n        He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the\\n        strange light.  He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the\\n        shadows between the rows of pillars.\\n\\n        A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop.  Nothing\\n        special about him.  Certainly not built like a terminator.  The flash\\n        of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he\\n        just arrived from the future.  His features are handsome bordering\\n        on severe.  His eyes are gray ice.  Penetrating.  Intelligent.\\n\\n        THE COP spins at a sound.  Too late.  Mr. X is already on him.  The\\n        blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand.\\n\\n        LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his BERETTA 9mm\\n        AUTOMATIC clattering next to him.

SECOND FLOOR/ELEVATORS\\n\\n        The elevator doors slide open with a whisper and MILES DYSON strides\\n        out.  Black.  In his early thirties.  The star of the Special\\n        Projects Division.  He\\'s brilliant, aggressive, driven.  Dyson walks\\n        down the corridor, swinging his arms... a man in a hurry.  A man\\n        with much to do.\\n\\n        He reaches a solid security door and zips his ELECTRONIC KEY-CARD\\n        through the scanner.  The door unlocks with a clunk.\\n        The sign next to the door reads: SPECIAL PROJECTS DIVISION:\\n        AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.\\n\\n34      INT.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (A.I.) LAB\\n\\n        The lab is quite large, comprising banks of processors, disk drives,\\n        test bays, prototype assembly areas.  Extremely high tech.\\n\\n                                DYSON\\n                Greetings, troops.\\n\\n        He is jokingly saluted by fellow members.  Not a lab coat in sight.\\n        This is strictly jeans and sneakers crowd.  All young and bright.\\n        They sit at their consoles drinking Coke and changing technology as\\n        we know it.  A young LAB ASSISTANT rushes over to Dyson.

Dyson and a GUARD stand together before\\n        what looks like a high-tech bank vault.  It requires two keys to\\n        open, like the launch controls in a nuclear silo.  The guard and\\n        Dyson insert their keys and turn them simultaneously.  Dyson then\\n        enters a passcode at a console and the vault unlocks itself with a\\n        sequence of clunks.  The door swings open and Dyson enters.  Bryant\\n        stays outside with the guard, who notes Dyson\\'s name and item on a\\n        clipboard.\\n\\n37      INT. VAULT\\n\\n        Dyson walks to a stainless steel cabinet and opens it.  Inside is a\\n        small artifact in a sealed container of inert gas.  IT -- a ceramic\\n        rectangle, about the size of a domino, the color of liver.  It has\\n        been shattered, painstakingly reconstructed and mounted on a metal\\n        frame.\\n\\n        Dyson removes the artifact, it its insert-gas, and sets it on a\\n        specially-designed cart.  He handles it like the Turin Shroud.\\n        Dyson closes the cabinet.  Turns to the one next to it.  Opens its\\n        door.  In this cabinet is a larger object... an intricate METAL HAND\\n        AND FOREARM.\\n\\n        At the elbow, the metal is twisted and crushed.  But the forearm and\\n        hand are intact.  Its metal surface scorched and discolored, it\\n        stands upright in a vacuum flask, as if saluting.  This is all that\\n        remains of the terminator Sarah destroyed.

Terminator\\'s\\n        body has blocked the bullets.\\n\\n        The Beretta CLACKS empty.  Terminator turns at the sound.\\n        Shoves John behind a Coke machine.  Drops the empty shotgun.

Neither the cop nor Terminator\\n        show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator\\'s\\n        wardrobe to shreds.\\n\\n        CLACK.  The pistol empties again.  Terminator stops two feet in front\\n        of the cop.  The appraise each other for a second.\\n\\n        We realize now that the cop is a terminator too.

Terminator moves first.\\n        He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a\\n        counter-grip.  After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls\\n        on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and\\n        the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and\\n        disappeared.\\n\\n        JOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move.  He staggers to\\n        his feet.  Stumble-runs toward the parking garage.\\n\\n44C     THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE.  A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator\\n        crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the\\n        screaming crowd.\\n\\n44D     T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after\\n        John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run.\\n\\n44E     Terminator is totally still.  A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps\\n        forward and takes a picture of the body.  Suddenly, Terminator\\'s\\n        eyes snap open.  The stunned tourist backs away.\\n\\n        He sits up and looks around.  Gets his bearings.  Rises smoothly to\\n        his feet.  All servos seem to be working fine.  The tourist\\'s camera\\n        whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show.\\n        The owner isn\\'t even looking through the eyepiece, he\\'s so shocked.\\n\\n45      INT. PARKING GARAGE\\n\\n        John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared\\n        shitless and the damned thing won\\'t start.  His hands are shaking so\\n        badly he can\\'t find the choke.  He looks up to see --\\n        The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him.\\n        John fumbles with the choke.  The bike catches.  He slams it in gear\\n        and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage.\\n\\n        John looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.  He twists the\\n        throttle and guns the little bike forward.  Incredibly, the T-1000\\n        is gaining.  This nightmare isn\\'t happening.  John races out the exit\\n        ramp, and charges right into the street.\\n\\n46      EXT. STREET\\n\\n        John shoots into the busy traffic.  Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK.\\n        The DRIVER swears.  Hits his air horn.  What the driver doesn\\'t see\\n        is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who\\n        emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck.\\n\\n46A     IN THE TRUCK.  The driver hears a thump as something slams against his\\n        door, then feels himself pulled right out.  T-1000 slides in and\\n        takes his place.  The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph.\\n        T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.  It can see him,\\n        up ahead, weaving through traffic.\\n\\n46B     Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the\\n        Harley.\\n        He accelerates after the others.\\n\\n47      EXT.

No sign of pursuit.\\n47A     Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow.\\n        The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring\\n        diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right\\n        into the center of the canal.\\n\\n        It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an\\n        angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of\\n        metal.  It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing\\n        like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering\\n        speed.\\n\\n47B     John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow\\n        concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike\\n        has.  The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train\\n        in a tunnel.  Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray,\\n        backlit in the setting sun.  It looks like some kind of demon.  And...\\n        it\\'s gaining.\\n\\n47C     ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is\\n        fighting to overtake them.  He looks down and sees John with the tow-\\n        truck from Hell catching up to him.  It is only about twenty feet\\n        behind him and still gaining.\\n\\n47D     ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall\\n        of metal filling frame behind him.\\n\\n47E     ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the\\n        road.  Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into\\n        the air like Steve McQueen in \"The Great Escape\" and vaults the fence\\n        bordering the canal.  It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears\\n        along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the\\n        truck in the canal below.\\n\\n47F     John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed.  The\\n        massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back\\n        fender.  Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.  All this is happening at\\n        about sixty miles and hour.  Top speed for the little dirt bike.\\n\\n47G     SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again.  This time the 700-\\n        pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.  It arcs\\n        down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.  It bottoms\\n        out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.  Only the ultra-fast\\n        reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.  Terminator fights\\n        for control.\\n\\n47H     He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John\\'s tiny\\n        Honda.\\n        Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him\\n        onto the Harley, in front of him.  John\\'s Honda weaves and falls,\\n        smashing instantly under thundering tires.\\n\\n        The Harley roars ahead.  It hits eighty.  Ahead is an overpass, and\\n        supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two\\n        channels.  The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially\\n        a short tunnel.\\n\\n47I     The truck can\\'t fit on either side.  Neither can it stop, at that\\n        speed.  Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into\\n        the concrete abutment at seventy.\\n\\n47J     Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a\\n        fireball blasting through behind them as the truck\\'s side-tanks\\n        explode.\\n\\n        Terminator stops the Harley.  John peers around his body to see the\\n        destruction.  A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in\\n        the mud.  Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal,\\n        disappearing around a bend.\\n\\n47K     ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass.\\n        Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of\\n        flame.  A figure appears in the fire.\\n        Just an outline.  Walking slowly... calmly.\\n        The figure emerges from the flames.\\n\\n        It is human-shaped but far from human.  A smooth chrome man.  Not a\\n        servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex\\n        hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome\\n        surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.  It\\n        reminds us of mercury.  A mercury man.  Its face is simple, unformed.\\n        Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us.\\n\\n        With each step detail returns.\\n        First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid\\n        chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features,\\n        ears...\\n\\n47K     But it\\'s still al chrome.  With its last step, the color returns to\\n        everything.  It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair,\\n        mustache.  Icy eyes.  It stops and looks around.\\n\\n        It is a perfect chameleon.  A liquid metal robot.  A killing machine\\n        with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society.\\n\\n47L     ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up.\\n        T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them.  More cops arrive.  T-1000\\n        blends in perfectly.  There are always cops at diasters and scenes of\\n        violence.  We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so\\n        perfect.\\n        It walks among the other cops unnoticed.\\n        Gets into one of the squad cars.  Starts it and drives away.\\n\\n48      EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT\\n\\n        Terminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the\\n        empty street.  John cranes his neck around to get a look at the\\n        person/thing he is riding with.  The image is strangely reminiscent\\n        of father/son, out for an evening ride.\\n\\n        John is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and\\n        he\\'s just a ten-year kid, but he\\'s also John Connor who will someday\\n        rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Whoa... time out.  Stop the bike!\\n\\n        Terminator immediately complies.  He leans the bike into a turn.\\n        They head into a nearby alley.\\n\\n49      EXT. ALLEY\\n\\n        Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop.  John\\n        slides off the gas tank.  Terminator impassively stares at him.  John\\n        checks him out.  Tentatively speaks.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Now don\\'t take this the wrong way, but you are\\n                a terminator, right?\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Yes.

STREET - NIGHT\\n\\n        John and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side\\n        streets.  They blend into the evening traffic.  In the darkness,\\n        Terminator\\'s wounds are not readily visible.  John cranes his head up\\n        and back.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                So this other guy?

You got a quarter?\\n\\n        Terminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off the\\n        phone\\'s cash box with the heel of his hand.  A shower of change\\n        tumbles out.  Terminator hands one to John.  John dials.\\n\\n52      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\\n\\n        Janelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her\\n        shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife.\\n        She answers sweetly.\\n\\n                                JANELLE\\n                Hello?\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                        (filtered through phone)\\n                Janelle?

Where are you, honey?  It\\'s late.  You\\n                should come home, dear.  I\\'m making a casserole.\\n\\n        AT THE PAYPHONE.  John listens, an odd look on his face.  He covers\\n        the phone\\'s mouthpiece and turns to Terminator.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                        (whispering)\\n                Something\\'s wrong.  She\\'s never this nice.\\n\\n        IN THE VOIGHTS\\' KITCHEN.  Todd comes through the kitchen\\'s back door.\\n        Just home from work.  He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge.  Grabs\\n        a carton of milk.  Takes a sip.  Frowns at the dog\\'s barking.\\n\\n                                TODD\\n                What the hell\\'s the goddamn dog barking at?\\n                SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!\\n\\n        TIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her.

There is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto\\n        the floor. (Don\\'t go away.

Calm.\\n\\n        PAN OVER along her arm, which is stretched out straight from the\\n        shoulder.  Partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into\\n        something else... a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-like\\n        spike.  Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by the\\n        spike which has punched through his milk carton, through his mouth\\n        and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door.  His eyes are\\n        glassy and lifeless.\\n\\n        The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT! -- so rapidly, Todd is actually\\n        standing there a second before he slumps out of sight.

VOIGHT HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT\\n\\n        T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it,\\n        barking in fear.  T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP.  Reaches down, OUT\\n        OF FRAME.  We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP.\\n        Then T-1000\\'s hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar.\\n        The tag reads \"MAX\".\\n        T-1000 nods thoughtfully.  Heads back to the house.\\n\\n55      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\\n\\n        Dark.  Off a quiet street.  Terminator stands near the Harley,\\n        watching John pace before him.

T-1000 finds a box of audio cassettes\\n        marked \"Messages from Mom\".  In it are some letters, and envelopes\\n        filled with snapshots.

The\\n        guy flinches, stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear.  He stares,\\n        shocked.  Pissing himself.

He gets a glimpse of the responsibility\\n        that comes with power.  Finally he hands the .45 back to Terminator,\\n        who puts it away.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Look, I\\'m gonna go get my mom.

We see the blurry forms of the cop frozen in the emergency\\n        lights of a burning corridor.\\n\\n        A black-clad figure stands at the end of the corridor.  The guy has\\n        short-cropped hair and dark glasses.  An AR-80 assault rifle in one\\n        hand, and a 12-gauge in the other -- holding them both like toy\\n        pistols.\\n        ANOTHER PHOTO is slapped on top of the first.

He bends down.  We think he\\'s going to kiss her.\\n        Instead he runs his tongue across her face like a dog would.  She\\n        seems not to even see him.  Her dull eyes past him.  He can\\'t\\n        provoke a reaction.  Even here, strapped down, the two of them alone,\\n        she give him no superiority.  He smirks and leaves.

There is intensity and resolve in\\n        them.  She slips the paper clip out from between her fingers and\\n        awkwardly spreads it open into a straight piece of wire.

Too weird.\\n\\n66A     Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and\\n        Weathersby, the two uniformed cops, and the hospital security guard.\\n        The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind the\\n        night desk.

As the\\n        guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and\\n        walks him, like it\\'s carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the\\n        night desk.  The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor.\\n\\n66F     ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past,\\n        dragging something casually which she can\\'t see because it\\'s below\\n        the countertop.\\n\\n                                NIGHT NURSE\\n                Whatcha got, Lewis?\\n\\n                                T-1000/GUARD\\n                Just some trash.\\n\\n        She nods, uninterested.  Keeps typing.  T-1000 moves past, dragging\\n        the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night\\n        receiving station.  T-1000/Guard removes the Browning High-Power\\n        pistol and the keys from the real guard\\'s belt, then stuffs the body\\n        into the utility closet.\\n\\n66G     INT.

Instead of\\n        setting the gun in the locker, it inserts the pistol into it own\\n        chest, where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of\\n        hot fudge.  It withdraws its hand.  The chest is once again a surface\\n        that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc.  You\\'d ever guess it was\\n        really an intelligent liquid metal.\\n\\n        T-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button\\n        unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK.  T-1000/Guard goes through.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n67      INT. ISOLATION SECURITY CHECKPOINT\\n\\n        A small room before a short SALLY-PORT corridor designed to prevent\\n        violent inmates from making a run for it.  There are doors at each\\n        end.  The first one is barred like a jail-cell door, and the second\\n        is a steel fire door.  The attendants have a video monitor with which\\n        they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors.\\n\\n        The two bored attendants barely notice the T-1000/Guard as it\\n        approaches.  Looks briefly at a chart next to the door, seeing\\n        SARAH CONNOR is in #19.\\n\\n67A     IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 passes a nurses\\' station which looks\\n        a cage, walled in by heavy metal mesh.  Silberman, leaning in the open\\n        doorway, is talking to an attendant in the cage.  He doesn\\'t glance\\n        twice at Lewis the Guard passing by.\\n\\n68      SARAH, moving like a ghost in the darkened corridor, hears footsteps\\n        coming and quietly but quickly unlocks a cell next to her with\\n        Douglas\\' master key.\\n68A     She slips into the cell and waits as the footsteps pass.\\n        We glimpse the T-1000/Guard pass the window.\\n        She waits as the footsteps fade away.  She looks over.  A female\\n        inmate, strapped to a bed, watches her with bird-like eyes.  She puts\\n        a finger to her lips -- SSHHH.  The inmate nods.  Sarah exits.\\n\\n68B     POV MOVING TOWARD nurse\\'s station.  We hear Silberman\\'s voice,\\n        reviewing medication with the night attendant.\\n\\n        ON SILBERMAN, yawning, looking at his watch.\\n        He turns to go... Sarah is there.\\n        She slams into him, hurling him through the door into the cage and\\n        follows him in.  The orderly jumps up, going for his stunner, but she\\n        nails him with Douglas\\' baton.  WHAP-WHAP-WHAP!  You can barely see\\n        the thing she\\'s swinging it so fast.  The guys goes down.\\n\\n        Silberman lunges for the alarm button and she cracks down hard on his\\n        arm.  He cries out and grabs his wrist.\\n        She grabs him by the hair and slams him face down on the desk,\\n        smacking him behind the knees expertly with the baton.\\n        His legs buckle and he drops to his knees with his chin on the desk.\\n        She pins him with one hand.  He face is full of outraged disbelief.\\n\\n                                SILBERMAN\\n                You broke my arm!\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                There\\'s 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker.\\n                That\\'s one.  Now don\\'t move!\\n\\n68B     Moving rapidly, she whips open a medication drawer and grabs a\\n        syringe.\\n        They keep a few of these handy for tranking unruly patients.  She\\n        jams it into the orderly\\'s butt and fires the whole shot.  Still\\n        holding the empty syringe, she sees what she need next.\\n        They keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the inmates from\\n        drinking Drano.  She grabs a plastic jug of LIQUID PLUM\\'R and slams\\n        it down on the desk inches from Silberman\\'s eyes.\\n\\n        She jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug.\\n        Draws back the plunger.  The syringe fills with blue liquid.\\n        She whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into Silberman\\'s neck.\\n        His horrified eyes rack toward it.  10 cc\\'s of blue death fill the\\n        cylinder.\\n        Her thumb hovers over the plunger.\\n        She jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip on him,\\n        then hauls him through the door.\\n\\n69      IN THE CORRIDOR outside cell #19 the T-1000 stops and looks in the\\n        window.

The orderlies\\n        charge after her.\\n        She\\'s like an animal in a maze.  She turns the corner, glancing off\\n        the wall, and sprints on without slowing.

Slams it.\\n        She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch\\n        on the other side.  He\\'s too late.\\n\\n        Sarah sees them beyond the window, fumbling with their keys.\\n\\n73A     Sarah is in another sally-port corridor.  A jail-cell type barred\\n        door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond.\\n        She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door.\\n        She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of\\n        the one she just came through being unlocked.\\n\\n        She flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first\\n        orderly comes through behind her.\\n        She slams the bars shut.

An instant later the big orderly slams\\n        against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances\\n        back just out of reach.\\n        He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off.\\n\\n        Sarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies.\\n        They\\'re shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the\\n        lock --\\n        The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in.\\n        Silberman shouts at them.\\n\\n                                SILBERMAN\\n                Go around, goddamnit!

At a full-tilt sprint, she\\'s nearly there when\\n        the elevator doors part...\\n\\n        TERMINATOR steps out... his head swivels to face her.\\n        Sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares.\\n        Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward.\\n        Her bare feet slip on the slick tile.  She slams to the floor,\\n        staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun.\\n\\n        She loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity.\\n        She\\'s not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be\\n        screaming if she could get the breath to do it.\\n        In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a\\n        crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall.\\n\\n        She runs like the wind, like in her nightmare.  If she looked back she\\n        would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind\\n        Terminator.  John, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing Sarah and\\n        figures out instantly what happened.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Mom!!  Wait!\\n\\n        Sarah doesn\\'t hear.  She has clicked fully into her own nightmare.\\n        They take off running after Sarah.\\n\\n73C     She is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came.  As she\\n        reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad figure\\n        blurs from that corridor.  The orderly hits her in a flying tackle.\\n        She skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling.  The other two\\n        orderlies leap into the fray.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                No!  Help me!  Goddamnit, it\\'s gonna kill us\\n                all!!!\\n\\n        She is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is\\n        coming.  They grab her thrashing arms and legs.  They don\\'t even look\\n        where the out-of-control woman is pointing... back along the corridor.\\n\\n        They have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her.\\n        Silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of\\n        trank.  Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of\\n        Terminator coming up behind them.  It is exactly her nightmare.\\n        She screams in utter hopelessness.\\n\\n        Terminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs\\n        one of the orderlies with his other hand.  He hurls the 200-pound\\n        guys against the far wall of the corridor.  SMACK!  He drops to the\\n        floor.\\n        The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder.\\n        Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys.\\n        Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are\\n        flung outward like they stepped on a land mine.\\n        One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a\\n        two-story fall by the outer steel bars.  The other crashes through an\\n        office door, splintering it into kindling.\\n\\n        Silberman has jumped to hold Sarah.  He is grabbed by a roll of skin\\n        at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat.  The doctor feel his\\n        feet pedaling above the ground.  He looks into the expressionless\\n        face.  And it hit him.  Sarah was right... this guy isn\\'t human.\\n        He feels the fabric of reality crumbling.\\n        Then he feels himself flying through the air.  The wall smacks him,\\n        then the floor kicks him in the face.  He decides to lie there a\\n        second.\\n\\n        Sarah blinks, staring up at the figure looming over her.\\n        John kneels next to her.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                Mom, are you okay?\\n\\n        She looks from Terminator to John.  Back to Terminator.\\n        Is this a nightmare?  Or has she finally gone truly bad?\\n\\n        Incredibly, Terminator politely reaches his hand down to her, offering\\n        to help her up.  The last thing she ever expected to see.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Come with me if you want to live.\\n\\n        The orderlies are stirring.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                It\\'s all right, Mom.  He\\'s here to help.\\n\\n        Sarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers.\\n        Terminator lifts her to her feet.\\n\\n73D     John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the\\n        walls of bars.  John doesn\\'t know what we know, but he knows\\n        something\\'s not right with this guy.  Terminator turns to follow\\n        John\\'s gaze.\\n        The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand, at its side.\\n        Terminator pushes John behind him.  They start backing up.\\n\\n73E     The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars.  It doesn\\'t stop.\\n        Its body divides like jello around the bars.  As it squeezes itself\\n        through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our\\n        side.  We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste\\n        forced past an obstacle.\\n        Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this.\\n        That faint snapping sound is his mind.\\n        There is a CLANK and we see that the guard\\'s gun has caught against\\n        the bars... the only solid object.  The T-1000 turns its wrist and\\n        tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap.\\n\\n73F     Sarah is agape.  Not reacting.  It\\'s been a heavy day for her.\\n        Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto\\n        his back.  John grabs him around the neck.  Terminator raises the\\n        shotgun and starts backing up.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Go!  Run!\\n\\n        Sarah doesn\\'t need to be told twice.\\n        T-1000 walks toward them, opening fire with the Browning Hi-Power.\\n        Terminator straight-arms the 12-guage like a pistol and FIRES.\\n        The stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is\\n        filled with high-velocity lead.  One of them, stupidly running for the\\n        cross-corridor, gets hit by the T-1000.\\n\\n        Terminator is hammered by several slugs, and the T-1000 is cratered\\n        by two buckshots hits.  It staggers, but comes on.  In the craters\\n        we see bright mercury before they close and reseal, disappearing in a\\n        second.\\n\\n73G     Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run.  Ahead,\\n        Sarah is already at the elevator.  Terminator and John pile in and\\n        John slaps the button for \"Garage Level\".\\n\\n        The doors start to close.  T-1000 clears the corner.\\n        Terminator slams John and Sarah back against the side walls as the\\n        T-1000 charges at them, rapid firing the Browning.\\n        The rounds hit the steel doors as they close.\\n        T-1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap.\\n73H     Inside, they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that\\n        are punching holes in the other side.\\n\\n73I     The Browning locks open, empty.  T-1000 drops it without a glance\\n        back.  The doors close.  K-WHAM!  The T-1000 hits them a split second\\n        later.  The elevator hasn\\'t moved yet.  SSWWIKK!\\n\\n73J     A sword-like blade rams through in between the doors, forcing them\\n        open.  Terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap.  Punches\\n        the muzzle right INTO T-1000\\'s face -- BOOM!!\\n73K     We get a glimpse of the T-1000\\'s head blown apart by the blast.  It\\n        is hurtled back.  The doors close.  The car descends.\\n\\n73L     ON THE T-1000, outside the elevator.  Its head, which is blown apart\\n        into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders, reforms quickly.\\n        There is no trace of the injury.  It sees the closed door and jams its\\n        hands between them, its fingertips becoming pry-bars.  It pulls the\\n        doors apart with inhuman strength\\n73M     and LEAPS INTO THE OPEN SHAFT.\\n        It falls two floors and...\\n\\n74      IN THE ELEVATOR.  Out trio hears a loud THUMP on the roof.\\n        Terminator, reloading the shotgun, looks up.\\n        Sarah grabs the .45 from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling.\\n        BEAT...\\n        Then CLANGG!! a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears\\n        down four feet into the elevator car.\\n        It is inches from Sarah\\'s face.\\n        She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof.\\n        Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again, slashing\\n        Terminator\\'s jacket, and missing John by inches.\\n        Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in\\n        the ceiling.\\n        Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal\\n        shafts slash down again and again.  Sarah yells in pain as one of them\\n        slices open her upper arm.\\n\\n75      The doors open.  Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is wide\\n        enough.\\n        They emerge into the basement.  We see the Harley parked nearby.\\n\\n        Terminator, in a rearguard action, fires another blast through the\\n        ceiling and runs out.  He throws his leg over the Harley, kicks it to\\n        life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the\\n        inner pocket of his jacket.  He throws it to John.  A road flare!?\\n\\n76      In the elevator, the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big\\n        enough to...\\n        Pour itself through.\\n        A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening.  The mass drops\\n        through the hole, down out of frame, then comes back up into frame\\n        as Officer X.\\n\\n        It seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after\\n        doing this king of taffy-pull with itself.  It opens its eyes and\\n        sees --\\n\\n77      TERMINATOR, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring\\n        Harley twenty feet away.  Terminator twists the throttle and pops the\\n        clutch.\\n        The back tire screams on the concrete.  The front wheel lifts off the\\n        ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie.\\n\\n        Terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator.\\n        The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right through the\\n        back wall of the elevator.\\n        Terminator rolls to his feet.\\n        Johns strikes the flare on the concrete.  Tosses it.\\n        Terminator catches the life flare with one hand.\\n        Levels the shotgun with the other.\\n        With his last round he blows a big hole in the bike\\'s gas tank.\\n        Gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling T-1000.\\n        Terminator tosses the flare.  KA-VOOOM!\\n\\n        The explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him\\n        in the fireball.  He gets up, smoking, and runs after John and Sarah\\n        toward the exit ramp.\\n\\n78      AT THE EXIT RAMP.  They are partway up when a blue-and-white hospital\\n        security car comes screeching down the other way.\\n        Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car.  It skids to a\\n        shrieking halt.  She\\'s in the guy\\'s face with the .45 in both hands.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                Out of the car!!\\n\\n        The patrol guy is thinking what he can try when BLAM! she puts a round\\n        through the glass next to his head.\\n\\n                                SARAH\\n                RIGHT NOW!\\n\\n        The door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as\\n        Terminator arrives.  The cyborg flings the rent-a-cop out of the way\\n        and slides behind the wheel.  Sarah gets John into the back seat and\\n        dives into the front passenger seat as --\\n\\n78A     Terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it, lighting up the\\n        tires on the slick ramp.\\n        Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and tells him\\n        to reload.  John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket\\n        and starts feeding them in.\\n        Terminator power backward up the ramp, scraping along one wall, barely\\n        in control.  Because...\\n\\n79      The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below.\\n        This guy won\\'t quit.  Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as it\\n        runs.\\n        It sprints up the ramp after the retreating car.  T-1000 is gaining.\\n\\n80      Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the .45.  She snatches\\n        it, drops the other out, and slaps in the new one.  Cocks the slide.\\n        The car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate.\\n        John hands the shot gun back to Terminator.\\n        He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer.\\n        The T-1000\\'s face is right in the headlights.\\n80A     Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder.  Shiny liquid metal\\n        visible in the hole, which then closes.\\n80B     Sarah, half out the passenger window, opens fire.\\n        The car crashes backward through the security barricade.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                        (calmly)\\n                Hang on.\\n\\n        He cuts the wheel hard.  The car slews into a reverse 180, swapping\\n        ends with a screech.\\n        T-1000 is almost on them.\\n        Terminator punches it.  The car accelerates forward.\\n\\n80C     T-1000 leaps.  Lands on the trunk.\\n        Its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid.\\n        Feet dragging on the pavement, it slams its other hand down,\\n        punching another metal hook into the trunk lid, pulling itself up.\\n        Terminator turns to Sarah.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Drive.\\n\\n        Terminator heaves himself half out the driver\\'s window.  Sarah slaps\\n        her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side.\\n\\n80D     T-1000, fully on the car now, holds on with one hook-hand while it\\n        slams the other into the back window, sweeping away the glass and\\n        missing John by inches as he ducks.\\n        It draws back for another swing, lunging forward as --\\n\\n80E     Terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car.\\n        Fires point-blank.\\n        Hits the T-1000\\'s arm just above the \"hand\" which anchors it to the\\n        car.  The 12-guage blows the arm apart, severing the hook-hand.\\n\\n80F     T-1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car.\\n        John looks out the back window, his eyes wide.\\n        He sees the T-1000 roll to his feet and continue running.\\n        But he\\'s dropping way behind now.  Sarah has the car floored and the\\n        liquid-metal killer won\\'t catch them on foot.\\n\\n80G     John watches, in awe, as the \"crowbar hand\", stuck into the trunk\\n        right in front of him, reverts to the neutral polyalloy... a kind of\\n        think mercury.  The gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and\\n        falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob.\\n\\n80H     The car speeds off into the night.\\n        REVERSE on the T-1000, walking now, coming right up into closeup,\\n        watching the tail lights recede.

There is a\\n        .45-caliber hole clean through his left shoulder.  He smears the wall\\n        with blood as he staggers up.  Looking back, he sees the implacable\\n        figure behind him, coming on.\\n\\n        He topples through a doorway as --\\n        BOOM!  BOOM!

She is\\n        bathed in sweat, and it runs into her eyes.  Blinking, she wipes it\\n        fast with one hand, then gets it back on the gun.  The .45 is\\n        trembling.\\n\\n        TIGHT ON SARAH as we see the forces at war behind her eyes.\\n        She looks into the faces of Dyson, Tarissa, Blythe, Danny.\\n        Sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms contract\\n        as she tenses to fire.\\n        But her finger won\\'t do it.\\n        She lowers the gun very slowly.  It drops to her side in one hand.\\n\\n        All the breath and energy seems to go out of her.\\n        She weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture, like \"Stay\\n        where you are, don\\'t move\".  As if, should they move, the fragile\\n        balance might tip back the other way.\\n        She backs away from them slowly, panting.  It\\'s as if she\\'s backing\\n        away in terror from what she almost did.  She reaches a wall and\\n        slumps against it.  Slides down to her knees.  The gun falls limply\\n        from her fingers.\\n        She rests her cheek against the wall.\\n\\n136A    The front door is kicked in.\\n        Terminator steps inside.

John moves to Sarah while Terminator checks Dyson.\\n\\n        John kneels in front of his mother.  She raises her head to look at\\n        him.

She hugs him fiercely\\n        as the sobs wrack her.\\n\\n        John clutches her shoulders.  It is all he ever wanted.\\n\\n                                JOHN\\n                It\\'s okay.

She wipes her tears, the instinct to\\n        toughen up taking over again.  But the healing moment has had its\\n        effect, nevertheless.\\n\\n        John walks toward Dyson and Terminator.\\n\\n                                DYSON\\n                Who are you people?\\n\\n\\n        John draws the Biker\\'s knife from Terminator\\'s boot.

In one smooth motion, Terminator cuts all the way\\n        around his arm.  With a second cut, he splits the skin of the forearm\\n        from elbow to wrist.\\n\\n        TERMINATOR grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a\\n        surgeon rips off a rubber glove.  It comes off with a sucking rip,\\n        leaving a bloody skeleton.\\n\\n        But the skeleton is made of bright metal, and is laced with hydraulic\\n        actuators.  The fingers are as finely crafted as watch parts... they\\n        flex into a fist and extend.  Terminator holds it up, palm out, in\\n        almost the exact position of the one in the vault at Cyberdyne,\\n\\n        HOLD ON DYSON reacting to the servo-hand in front of him.\\n        He\\'s seen one of these before.\\n        Tarissa is screaming now, but he doesn\\'t hear her.\\n\\n                                DYSON\\n                My God.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Now listen to me very carefully.\\n\\n137     INT.

She\\'s sitting on the counter.\\n        John, Terminator, Dyson, and Tarissa are at the kitchen table, under\\n        a single overhead light.\\n\\n        Dyson looks like that guy on the Sistine Chapel wall, the damned\\n        soul... eyes fixed and staring with terrifying knowledge.  His\\n        shoulder is bandaged.  Terminator\\'s arm is wrapped with a blood-soaked\\n        bandage below the elbow.  The steel forearm and hand gleam in the\\n        harsh kitchen light.

His face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul-wrenching\\n        terror.  This is a man ripped out of normal life into their grim\\n        world.  His voice is pleading.\\n\\n                                DYSON\\n                You\\'re judging me on thing\\'s I haven\\'t even\\n                done yet.  Jesus.

The back doors of the van are crushed in as\\n        the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK,\\n        trapping the T-1000 inside the twisted metal.  The chopper hits the\\n        pavement, flips, sideways, and cartwheels... smashing itself into a\\n        shapeless mass of twisted metal.\\n        It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end.\\n\\n182A    Terminator fights to control the van, which is fishtailing violently\\n        from the impact.  It smashes up against the center divider, screeching\\n        along the concrete, and then pulls away.  Terminator puts the hammer\\n        down and the van accelerates.  He swerves to avoid an UGLY PICKUP\\n        crawling like a snail ahead.\\n\\n        THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER of the van, crumpled by slamming the wall, is\\n        sawing into the tire.  The tire blows and peels off the clean rim.\\n        The steel wheel grinds across the pavement, striking trails of sparks,\\n        and the van slides sideways and topples --\\n        STEEL SCREAMS on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on its side.\\n\\n182B    INSIDE THE VAN, John crawls to Sarah, who is groaning and holding her\\n        bleeding leg.  She is white and shocky.  Terminator starts to\\n        extricate himself from the crumpled driver\\'s seat.\\n\\n183     BACK DOWN THE ROAD, THE HELICOPTER wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk\\n        metal, unrecognizable.  Behind it, the TANKER TRUCK brakes hard, \\n        shuddering and groaning, trying to stop.  The big tires lock up in\\n        clouds of tire-smoke.

Releases the brake.\\n        As the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters\\n        on the side which say \"CRYOCO INC.  LIQUID NITROGEN SUPPLY\\'.\\n\\n184     AT THE SWAT VAN John and Terminator are carrying Sarah out of the\\n        wreck.  Terminator has the M-79 slung over his shoulder, the\\n        bandolier of grenades, and his .45 stuck in his waistband.  John has\\n        borrowed a 12-GAUGE RIOT GUN from the SWATs.\\n\\n184A    The pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them.  The DRIVER,\\n        A Hispanic guy in his 50\\'s, is getting out to help them.  Terminator\\n        and John hear a CRASH and look back as the\\n185     helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck.\\n\\n186                             JOHN\\n                Holy shit.

John\\n        runs to the passenger side.\\n\\n187     THE TANKER ROARS, spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts\\n        up through the gears.\\n\\n188     Terminator slams the pickup in gear, checking the rear-view.  The\\n        tanker is a hundred feet behind them now, and really moving.\\n        Terminator puts the throttle down, but the pickup is and old slug\\n        loaded down by a heavy home-made wooden camper-shell.  It accelerates\\n        slowly.\\n\\n189     THE TANKER slams into one end of the SWAT van, spinning it out of the\\n        way with a roar and screech of twisting metal.  The 18-wheeler shifts\\n        to a higher gear, still accelerating.\\n\\n190     INT./EXT.

It flies over the top of the truck.\\n\\n191E    Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up.\\n        He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed.\\n191F    POOM!  The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.  It EXPLODES\\n        against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top.  Liquid\\n        nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream.\\n\\n191G    The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control.

He turns and sees\\n        what they are running from...\\n\\n193G    The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker.  It is\\n        a strange vista of fire and ice.  The huge SMELTERS pour out orange\\n        light and fire from the sides of the huge galley, while the freezing\\n        vapor rolls down the center.\\n\\n193H    TIGHT ON THE WRECK.  A billowing gray cloud.  Deep inside, the shape\\n        of the cab in visible.  A FIGURE emerges, pulling itself out.  It\\n        drops to the floor.  The hissing, boiling river of liquid nitrogen\\n        flows around its feet.\\n\\n194     The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully.  It has finally been\\n        affected by something.  Its feet are freezing to the ground as it\\n        walks...\\n\\n194A    CLINK!  One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle.  It stumbles\\n        forward, and --\\n194B    Its other foot snaps off.  As it catches its balance on the stump of\\n        its other ankle,\\n194C    the whole lower leg shatters at the impact.

The hand snaps off at the wrist.\\n        It looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist.  For the first time\\n        we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one...\\n        The expression is pain.  Agony.  Its mouth opens in a soundless\\n        scream as the hoar-frost races up its legs, across its body.\\n194E    And that\\'s the position it freezes in.\\n        It has become a statue, kneeling in the frozen vapor, that surprised\\n        look of agony frozen on its face.\\n\\n        The liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate.\\n194F    Terminator, just beyond the boundary of the cold, can see the T-1000\\n        clearly.\\n        He draws his .45 and aims.\\n\\n                                TERMINATOR\\n                Hasta la vista, baby.\\n\\n194G    K-POW!

With titanic effort he spreads the\\n        massive components which are holding him, and withdraws him arm, which\\n        is severed at the elbow.  Dangling junk hands from the crushed joint.\\n\\n207     SARAH has lost sight of John.  It is much of a goodbye as they will\\n        have.\\n        She turns as the T-1000 closes on her.  She is half-slumped against\\n        the sooty machines, looking barely conscious.  She struggles to load\\n        a shell into the empty weapon.  At the last instant she whips up the\\n        RIOT GUN and FIRES.\\n\\nA207    T-1000\\'s face is blown open, but quickly reforms as it closes on her.\\n        She fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but --\\nA208    THUNK!  A steel needle slams through her shoulder, pinning her.\\n        The polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand.

SOMETHING whistles down on the T-1000 with such force that is\\n        cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval.  The 6-foot steel\\n        bar is imbedded in its body.  Terminator hurls the killer off Sarah.\\n\\n207D    The T-1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with\\n        fury.\\n        Swinging again and again.  Hammering Terminator back.  Terminator\\n        falls back against the wall.\\n\\n        Behind the T-1000 is an enormous I-beam, hanging from two chains.  It\\n        is used to lift ingots into the smelters, and it runs on a linear\\n        track.\\n207E    The T-1000 grabs the I-beam and rolls it down the track.  Straight at\\n        Terminator.  The two-ton girder smashes into his chest, crushing the\\n        armor.\\n        The T-1000 pulls the I-beam back, and then heaves it forward again.\\n        Terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder.  We hear\\n        metal crush and break inside him.  He sags, turning to grip the\\n        wall...\\n        The third blow slams into his back, smashing his spine and pelvis.  We\\n        hear servos ratcheting and failing.  He drops to his knees, crucified\\n        on a wall of machinery.\\n        The fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades.  Sound of\\n        crushing metal.  His skull is partially caved in.\\n        He slides to the floor.\\n\\n207F    ON THE T-1000, emotionless as it walks forward.\\n\\n207G    TERMINATOR is a pathetic shape on the floor.  He is trying to crawl,\\n        feebly.\\n        Dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine.  His arm\\n        stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward.  His\\n        exposed machine eye burns red with determination.\\n\\n        We see his prize.  He has the M-79, with the breech still open, \\n        cradled in the crook of his ruined arm.  He good hand, the exposed\\n        steel one, is reaching for the last grenade, which is visible under\\n        the skirt of the massive smelter base.  His metal fingers reach out\\n        for it as --\\n\\n207H    The T-1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down\\n        with unbelievable force.  It punches into Terminator\\'s back, through a\\n        gap in the shattered armor.  The T-1000 levers it back and forth,\\n        widening the hole.  Then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it\\n        down.\\n        It punches right through.  Emerging from Terminator\\'s chest.\\n        And into the floor.  He is pinioned.  The cyborg sags face down and\\n        stop moving.  The light goes out of his eye.\\n\\n                                                CUT TO:\\n\\n208     INT.

Heat shimmers\\n        the air, giving everything a hallucinatory quality.\\n\\n        John sees Sarah nearby, limping toward him.  She can barely move, her\\n        leg bathed in blood.

The grenade EXPLODES inside\\n        its body.  A huge hole is blown clean through it, and it is ripped\\n        open and peeled back, half inside-out.  It topples into the molten\\n        steel and --\\n\\n211     The T-1000\\'s head and upper body reappear above the molten steel.\\n        It is screaming.

This file contains the script as it was on March 20 1974,\\nbefore filming took place. There are many minor differences from what\\nappears here and what ended up on the screen. <I.E. A paraphrased word\\nor two or another character used a line... But generally in minor\\nlines like \\'LOOK!\\'> This file also contains cut scenes and lines from\\nthe film.\\n\\nI tried to preserve as much of the screenplay as possible but it isn\\'t\\neasy to cross out a section and pencil in new dialogue, in ASCII. Any\\nScene or dialogue that was crossed out begins with a \"|\" before\\nit. Anything Penciled in has a \"+\", I also put cut information before\\npenciled in.\\n\\nWhat is interesting about a screenplay is to see what they threw out\\nand what \"Catch Phrases\" were literally penciled in. The reason I\\nkeyed in this file was caused by me downloading current transcript\\ngoing around internet. It was an amazing job... I wouldn\\'t want to\\nhave attempted what he did... But it wasn\\'t in a good script format\\nand I didn\\'t like how direction was written in. Since I HAD the real\\nscreenplay I thought... What the hell!\\n\\nAfter This I plan to key in \"Monty Python\\'s Second Film\" it is the 1st\\ndraft of the Holy Grail. It is the script that eventually got\\ncannibalized into sketches for the 4th season of Python. It Is sill\\nquite different and well worth a read. Is anybody interested in\\nit?????\\n\\nOh yes... I will STRESS this fact once more... THIS IS A\\nSCREENPLAY... So don\\'t yell at me if a line is paraphrased in the\\nfilm... This is what was written before filming took place and it is\\nstill quite accurate.\\n\\nEnough of this...\\n\\n-Grue (09-Aug-92)\\n\\nP.S. TO AHH: DON\\'T YOU KNOW WHO CONNIE BOOTH OR CAROL CLEVELAND\\nIS?!?!?!AND DON\\'T YOU KNOW WHAT GRAHAM CHAPMAN SOUNDS LIKE?!?!?! Sorry\\nI just had to say that...

Several seconds of it swirling about. silence possibly,\\natmospheric music. SUPERIMPOSE \"England AD 787\". after a few more\\nseconds we hear hoofbeats in the distance. They come slowly\\ncloser. Then out of the mist comes KING ARTHUR followed by a SERVANT\\nwho is banging two half coconuts together. ARTHUR raises his hand.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhoa there!\\n\\nSERVANT makes noises of horses halting, with a flourish. ARTHUR peers\\nthrough the mist. CUT TO shot from over his shoulder: castle\\n(e.g. Bodium) rising out of the mist. On the castle battlements a\\nSOLDIER is dimly seen. He peers down.\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nHalt! Who goes there?\\n\\nARTHUR \\nIt is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of\\nCamelot. King of all Britons, defeater of the Saxons, sovereign of all\\nEngland!\\n\\nPause.\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nGet away!\\n\\nARTHUR \\nI am... And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the\\nlength and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our\\ncourt at Camelot.. I must speak with your lord and master.\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nWhat? Ridden on a horse?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYes!\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nYou\\'re using coconuts!\\n\\nARTHUR\\n...What?\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nYou\\'ve got two empty halves of coconuts and you\\'re banging them together.\\n\\nARTHUR (Scornfully) \\nSo? We have ridden since the snows of winter\\ncovered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nWhere did you get the coconuts?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nThrough ... We found them.\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nFound them? In Mercea. The coconut\\'s tropical!\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nWell, this is a temperate zone.\\n\\nARTHUR \\nThe swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or\\nthe plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not\\nstrangers to our land.\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nAre you suggesting coconuts migrate?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nNot at all. They could be carried.\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nWhat? A swallow carrying a coconut?\\n\\n| ARTHUR\\n| Why not?\\n|\\n| SOLDIER\\n| I\\'ll tell you why not ... because a swallow is about eight inches long and\\n| weighs five ounces, and you\\'d be lucky to find a coconut under a pound.\\n|\\n\\nARTHUR\\nIt could grip it by the husk ...\\n\\nSOLDIER \\nIt\\'s not a question of where he grips it, It\\'s a simple matter\\nof weight - ratios ... A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound\\ncoconut.\\n\\nARTHUR \\nWell, it doesn\\'t matter. Go and tell your master that Arthur\\nfrom the Court of Camelot is here.\\n\\nA Slight pause. Swirling mist. Silence.\\n\\nSOLDIER \\nLook! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings\\nfour hundred and ninety three times every second. right?\\n\\nARTHUR\\n(irritated)\\nPlease!\\n\\nSOLDIER\\nAm I right?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nI\\'m not interested.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n(who has loomed up on the battlements)\\nIt could be carried by an African swallow!\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\nOh yes! An African swallow maybe ... but not a European\\nswallow. that\\'s my point.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\nOh yes, I agree there ...\\n\\nARTHUR\\n(losing patience)\\nWill you ask your master if he wants to join the Knights of Camelot?!\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\nBut then of course African swallows are non-migratory.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\nOh yes.\\n\\nARTHUR \\nraises his eyes heavenwards and nods to PATSY. They turn and go\\noff into the mist.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\nSo they wouldn\\'t be able to bring a coconut back anyway.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nWait a minute! Suppose two swallows carried it together?\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\nNo, they\\'d have to have it on a line.\\n\\nStillness. Silence again.\\n\\n\\n2 ANIMATION/LIVE ACTION SEQUENCE - DEATH AND DEVASTATION\\n\\nCUT TO Terry Gilliam\\'s sequence of Brueghel prints. Sounds of strange\\nmedieval music. Discordant and sparse. Wailings and groanings. The\\nlast picture mixes through into live action. BIG CLOSE UP of contorted\\nface upside down. A leg falls across it. Creaking noise. The bodies\\nlurch away from CAMERA to reveal they are amongst a huge pile of\\nbodies on a swaying cart that is lumbering away from CAMERA. It is\\npulled by a couple of ragged, dirty emaciated WRETCHES. Behind the\\ncart walks another MAN who looks slightly more prosperous, but only on\\nthe scale of complete and utter impoverishment. He wears a black hood\\nand looks sinister.\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nBring out your dead!\\n\\nWe follow the cart through a wretched, impoverished plague-ridden\\nvillage. A few starved mongrels run about in the mud scavenging. In\\nthe open doorway of one house perhaps we jug glimpse a pair of legs\\ndangling from the ceiling. In another doorway an OLD WOMAN is beating\\na cat against a wall rather like one does with a mat. The cart passes\\nround a dead donkey or cow in the mud. And a MAN tied to a cart is\\nbeing hammered to death by four NUNS with huge mallets.\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\n\\nBring out your dead!\\n\\nThere are legs stick out of windows and doors. Two MEN are fighting in\\nthe mud - covered from head to foot in it. Another MAN is on his hands\\nin knees shoveling mud into his mouth. We just catch sight of a MAN\\nfalling into a well.\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nBring out your dead!\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nHere\\'s one!\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nNinepence.\\n\\nBODY\\nI\\'m not dead!\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nWhat?\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nNothing... There\\'s your ninepence.\\n\\nBODY\\nI\\'m not dead!\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\n\\'Ere. He says he\\'s not dead.\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nYes he is.\\n\\nBODY\\nI\\'m not!\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nHe isn\\'t.\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nHe will be soon. He\\'s very ill.\\n\\nBODY\\nI\\'m getting better!\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nYou\\'re not. You\\'ll be stone dead in a few minutes.\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nI can\\'t take him like this. It\\'s against regulations.\\n\\nBODY\\nI don\\'t want to go on the cart.\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nDon\\'t be such a baby.\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nI can\\'t take him.\\n\\nBODY\\nI feel fine.\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nDo me a favor.\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nI can\\'t.\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nWell, can you hang around a couple of minutes. He won\\'t be long.\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nI promised I\\'d be at the Robinson\\'s. They\\'ve lost nine today.\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nWhen\\'s your next round?\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nThursday.\\n\\nBODY\\nI think I\\'ll go for a walk.\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nYou\\'re not fooling anyone you know.\\n(to CART DRIVER)\\nIsn\\'t there anything you could do?\\n\\nBODY\\n(singing unrecognizably)\\nI feel happy... I feel happy.\\n\\nThe CART DRIVER looks at the LARGE MAN for a moment. Then they both do\\na quick furtive look up and down the street. The CART DRIVER very\\nswiftly brings up a club and hits the OLD MAN. (Out of shot but the\\nsinging stops after a loud bonk noise.)\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\n(handing over the money at last)\\nThanks very much.\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nThat\\'s all right. See you on Thursday.\\n\\nThey turn ... Suddenly all the village fall to their knees, touching\\nforelocks etc. ARTHUR and PATSY ride into SHOT, slightly nose to the\\nair, they ride through without acknowledging anybody. After they pass,\\nthe LARGE MAN turns to the CART DRIVER.\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nWho\\'s that then?\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\n(Grudgingly)\\nI dunno, Must be a king.\\n\\nLARGE MAN\\nWhy?\\n\\nCART DRIVER\\nHe hasn\\'t got shit all over him.\\n\\n\\n3 EXTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nARTHUR and PATSY riding. They stop and look. We see a castle in the\\ndistance, and before it a PEASANT is working away on his knees trying\\nto dig up the earth with his bare hands and a twig. ARTHUR and PATSY\\nride up, and stop before the PEASANT\\n\\nARTHUR\\nOld woman!\\n\\nDENNIS\\nMan!\\n\\nARTHUR\\nMan. I\\'m sorry. Old man, What knight lives in that castle over there?\\n\\nDENNIS\\nI\\'m thirty-seven.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat?\\n\\nDENNIS:\\nI\\'m thirty-seven ... I\\'m not old.\\n\\nARTHUR:\\nWell - I can\\'t just say: \"Hey, Man!\\'\\n\\nDENNIS\\nWell you could say: \"Dennis\"\\n\\nARTHUR\\nI didn\\'t know you were called Dennis.\\n\\nDENNIS\\nYou didn\\'t bother to find out, did you?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nI\\'ve said I\\'m sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...\\n\\nDENNIS\\nWhat I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWell ... I AM king.\\n\\nDENNIS \\nOh, very nice. King, eh! I expect you\\'ve got a palace and fine\\nclothes and courtiers and plenty of food. And how d\\'you get that? By\\nexploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma\\nwhich perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!\\nIf there\\'s EVER going to be any progress ...\\n\\nAn OLD WOMAN appears.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN\\nDennis! There\\'s some lovely filth down here ... Oh! how d\\'you do?\\n\\nARTHUR \\nHow d\\'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons\\n... can you tell me who lives in that castle?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN\\nKing of the WHO?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nThe Britons.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN\\nWho are the Britons?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nAll of us are ... we are all Britons.\\n\\nDENNIS winks at the OLD WOMAN.\\n\\n... and I am your king ....\\n\\nOLD WOMAN \\nOoooh! I didn\\'t know we had a king. I thought we were an\\nautonomous collective ...\\n\\nDENNIS \\nYou\\'re fooling yourself. We\\'re living in a dictatorship, A\\nself-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes ...\\n\\nOLD WOMAN\\nThere you are, bringing class into it again ...\\n\\nDENNIS\\nThat\\'s what it\\'s all about ... If only -\\n\\nARTHUR\\nPlease, please good people. I am in haste. What knight lives in that castle?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN\\nNo one live there.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWell, who is your lord?\\n\\nOLD WOMAN\\nWe don\\'t have a lord.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat?\\n\\nDENNIS \\nI told you, We\\'re an anarcho-syndicalist commune, we take it in\\nturns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYes.\\n\\nDENNIS\\n... But all the decisions of that officer ...\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYes, I see.\\n\\nDENNIS \\n... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple\\nmajority in the case of purely internal affairs.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nBe quiet!\\n\\nDENNIS\\n... but a two-thirds majority ...\\n\\nARTHUR\\nBe quiet! I order you to shut up.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN\\nOrder, eh -- who does he think he is?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nI am your king!\\n\\nOLD WOMAN\\nWell, I didn\\'t vote for you.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou don\\'t vote for kings.\\n\\nOLD WOMAN\\nWell, how did you become king, then?\\n\\nARTHUR \\nThe Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering\\nsamite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by\\nDivine Providence ... that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That\\nis why I am your king!\\n|\\n| OLD WOMAN\\n| Is Frank in? He\\'d be able to deal with this one.\\n|\\n\\nDENNIS \\nLook, strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out\\nswords ... that\\'s no basis for a system of government. Supreme\\nexecutive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some\\nfarcical aquatic ceremony.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nBe quiet!\\n\\nDENNIS \\nYou can\\'t expect to wield supreme executive power just \\'cause\\nsome watery tart threw a sword at you!\\n\\nARTHUR\\nShut up!\\n\\nDENNIS \\nI mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some\\nmoistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!\\n\\nARTHUR\\n(Grabbing him by the collar)\\nShut up, will you. Shut up!\\n\\nDENNIS\\nAh! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nShut up!\\n\\nPEOPLE (i.e. other PEASANTS) are appearing and watching.\\n\\nDENNIS (calling) \\nCome and see the violence inherent in the\\nsystem. Help, help, I\\'m being repressed!\\n\\nARTHUR\\n(aware that people are now coming out and watching)\\nBloody peasant!\\n(pushes DENNIS over into mud and prepares to ride off)\\n\\nDENNIS\\nOh, Did you hear that! What a give-away.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nCome on, patsy.\\n\\nThey ride off.\\n\\nDENNIS\\n(in the background as we PULL OUT)\\ndid you see him repressing me, then? That\\'s what I\\'ve been on about ...\\n\\n\\n4 EXTERIOR - FOREST - DAY\\n\\nMIX THROUGH to ARTHUR and PATSY riding through the forest. They pass\\nrune stones. We TRACK with them. CLOSE-UPS of their faces as they\\nride. MIX to another TRACKING SHOT of them riding through the\\nforest. They come to a clearing and stop, looking ahead\\nintently. Their eyes light up.\\n\\nSound FX of fight.\\n\\nCUT TO their eyeline. A clearing on the other side of which is a rough\\nwooden foot-bridge across a stream. At the start of the bridge a\\ntremendous fight is going on. A huge BLACK KNIGHT in black armor, his\\nface totally masked in a visor, is fighting a slightly smaller KNIGHT\\nin green armor. (Perhaps the GREEN KNIGHT\\'s armor is identical to the\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\'s save for the color.)\\n\\nCUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY. They watch, growing more impressed as\\nthey watch the fight.\\n\\nCUT BACK TO the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT lunges at the BLACK KNIGHT,\\nwho avoids the blow with a skillful side-step and parry, knocking the\\nsword out of the GREEN KNIGHT\\'s hand.\\n\\nCUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY even more impressed.\\n\\nCUT BACK TO the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT has drawn out a particularly\\nnasty mace or spiked ball and chain, much longer than the BLACK\\nKNIGHT\\'s sword.\\n\\nARTHUR narrows his eyes, wondering whether the BLACK KNIGHT will survive.\\n\\nCUT BACK to the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT swings at the BLACK KNIGHT,\\nwho ducks under the first swing, leaps over the second and starts to\\nclose on the GREEN KNIGHT.\\n\\nCUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY watching like a tennis match. Sound FX of\\nthe fight reaching a climax. Four almighty clangs. Then Silence.\\n\\nCUT BACK to see the GREEN KNIGHT stretched out. The BLACK KNIGHT\\nsheathes his sword.\\n\\nARTHUR looks at PATSY. Nods and they move forward.\\n\\nCUT BACK TO the BLACK KNIGHT picking up the GREEN KNIGHT above his\\nhead and hurling him into the river. ARTHUR and PATSY approach him.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.\\n\\n| BLACK KNIGHT\\n| Who dares to challenge the Black Knight?\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| I do not challenge you.\\n\\nThe BLACK KNIGHT stares impassively and says nothing.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nI am Arthur, King of the Britons.\\n\\nHint of a pause as he waits for a reaction which doesn\\'t come. ARTHUR\\nis only slightly thrown.\\n\\n... I seek the bravest and the finest knights in all the world to join\\nme in my court at Camelot ...\\n\\nThe BLACK KNIGHT remains silent\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou have proved yourself worthy. ... Will you join me?\\n\\nSilence.\\n\\n| ARTHUR\\n| A man of your strength and skill would be the chief of all my knights ...\\n|\\n| BLACK KNIGHT\\n| Never.\\n|\\nARTHUR\\nYou make me sad. But so be it. Come Patsy.\\n\\nAs he moves, the BLACK KNIGHT bars the way.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nNone shall pass.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat?\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nNone shall pass.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nI have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nThen you shall die.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nI command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nI move for no man.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nSo be it!\\n\\nARTHUR draws his sword and approaches the BLACK KNIGHT. A furious\\nfight now starts lasting about fifteen seconds at which point ARTHUR\\ndelivers a mighty blow which completely severs the BLACK KNIGHT\\'s left\\narm at the shoulder. ARTHUR steps back triumphantly.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nNow stand aside worthy adversary.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\n(Glancing at his shoulder)\\n\\'Tis but a scratch.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nA scratch? Your arm\\'s off.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nNo, it isn\\'t.\\n\\nARTHUR\\n(Pointing to the arm on ground)\\nWell, what\\'s that then?\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nI\\'ve had worse.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou\\'re a liar.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nCome on you pansy!\\n\\nAnother ten seconds furious fighting till ARTHUR chops the BLACK\\nKNIGHT\\'s other arm off, also at the shoulder. The arm plus sword, lies\\non the ground.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nVictory is mine.\\n(sinking to his knees)\\nI thank thee O Lord that in thy ...\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nCome on then.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat?\\n\\nHe kicks ARTHUR hard on the side of the helmet. ARTHUR gets up still\\nholding his sword. The BLACK KNIGHT comes after him kicking.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nHad enough?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou stupid bastard. You haven\\'t got any arms left.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nCourse I have.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nLook!\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nWhat! Just a flesh wound.\\n(kicks ARTHUR)\\n\\nARTHUR\\nStop that.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\n(kicking him)\\nHad enough ... ?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nI\\'ll have your leg.\\n\\nHe is kicked.\\n\\nRight!\\n\\nThe BLACK KNIGHT kicks him again and ARTHUR chops his leg off. The\\nBLACK KNIGHT keeps his balance with difficulty.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nI\\'ll do you for that.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou\\'ll what ... ?\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nCome Here.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat are you going to do. bleed on me?\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nI\\'m invincible!\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou\\'re a loony.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nThe Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!\\n\\nARTHUR takes his last leg off. The BLACK KNIGHT\\'s body lands upright.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT\\nAll right, we\\'ll call it a draw.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nCome, Patsy.\\n\\nARTHUR and PATSY start to cross the bridge.\\n\\nBLACK KNIGHT \\nRunning away eh? You yellow bastard, Come back here and\\ntake what\\'s coming to you. I\\'ll bite your legs off!\\n\\n\\n5 EXTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nA village. Sound of chanting of Latin canon, punctuated by short,\\nsharp cracks. It comes nearer. We see it is a line of MONKS ala\\nSEVENTH SEAL flagellation scene, chanting and banging themselves on\\nthe foreheads with wooden boards. They pass a group of villagers who\\nare dragging a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN dressed as a witch through the\\nstreets. They drag her to a strange house/ruin standing on a hill\\noutside the village. A strange-looking knight stands outside, SIR\\nBEDEVERE.\\n\\nFIRST VILLAGER\\nWe have found a witch. May we burn her?\\n\\nALL\\nA Witch! Burn her!\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nHow do you know she is a witch?\\n\\nALL\\nShe looks like one. Yes, she does.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nBring her forward.\\n\\nThey bring her forward - a beautiful YOUNG GIRL (MISS ISLINGTON)\\ndressed up as a witch.\\n\\nWITCH\\nI am not a witch. I am not a witch.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nBut you are dressed as one.\\n\\nWITCH\\nThey dressed me up like this.\\n\\nALL\\nWe didn\\'t, we didn\\'t!\\n\\nWITCH\\nThis is not my nose, It is a false one.\\n\\nBEDEVERE takes her nose off.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nWell?\\n\\nFIRST VILLAGER\\n... Well, we did do the nose.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nThe nose?\\n\\nFIRST VILLAGER\\nAnd the hat. But she is a witch.\\n\\nALL\\nA witch, a witch, burn her!\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nDid you dress her up like this?\\n\\nFIRST VILLAGER\\n... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nWhy do you think she is a witch?\\n\\nSECOND VILLAGER\\nShe turned me into a newt.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nA newt?\\n\\nSECOND VILLAGER\\n(After looking at himself for some time)\\nI got better.\\n\\nALL\\nBurn her anyway.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nQuiet! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.\\n\\nARTHUR and PATSY ride up at this point and watch what follows with interest\\n\\nALL\\nThere are? Tell up. What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nTell me ... what do you do with witches?\\n\\nALL\\nBurn them.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nAnd what do you burn, apart from witches?\\n\\nFOURTH VILLAGER\\n... Wood?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nSo why do witches burn?\\n\\nSECOND VILLAGER\\n(pianissimo)\\n... Because they\\'re made of wood...?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nGood.\\n\\nPEASANTS stir uneasily then come round to this conclusion.\\n\\nALL\\nI see. Yes, of course.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nSo how can we tell if she is made of wood?\\n\\nFIRST VILLAGER\\nMake a bridge out of her.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nAh ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?\\n\\nALL\\nAh. Yes, of course ... um ... err ...\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nDoes wood sink in water?\\n\\nALL\\nNo, no, It floats. Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her. To the pond.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nWait. Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?\\n\\nALL\\nBread? No, no, no. Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...\\n\\nARTHUR\\nA duck.\\n\\nThey all turn and look at ARTHUR. BEDEVERE looks up very impressed.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nExactly. So... logically ...\\n\\nFIRST VILLAGER\\n(beginning to pick up the thread)\\nIf she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she\\'s made of wood.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nAnd therefore?\\n\\nALL\\nA witch! ... A duck! A duck! Fetch a duck.\\n\\nFOURTH VILLAGER\\nHere is a duck, Sir Bedevere.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nWe shall use my largest scales.\\n\\nHe leads them a few yards to a very strange contraption indeed, made\\nof wood and rope and leather. They put the GIRL in one pan and the\\nduck in another. Each pan is supported by a wooden stave. BEDEVERE\\nchecks each pan then ... ARTHUR looks on with interest.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nRemove the supports.\\n\\nTwo PEASANTS knock them away with sledge hammers. The GIRL and the\\nduck swing slightly but balance perfectly.\\n\\nALL\\nA witch! A witch!\\n\\nWITCH\\nIt\\'s a fair cop.\\n\\nAll\\nBurn her! Burn her! Let\\'s make her into a ladder.\\n\\nThe VILLAGERS drag the girl away, leaving ARTHUR and BEDEVERE\\nregarding each other admiringly.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nWho are you who are so wise in the ways of science?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nI am Arthur, King of the Britons.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nMy liege ... forgive me ...\\n\\nARTHUR looks at PATSY with obvious satisfaction.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nGood Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot,\\nand join our number at the Round Table?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nMy liege, I am honored.\\n\\nARTHUR steps forward, drawing his sword, with a slight hint of difficulty\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat is your name?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nBedevere, my Liege.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nThen I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!\\n\\n\\n|6 VARIOUS MONTAGE - ANIMATION\\n|\\n| VOICE OVER\\n| And so King Arthur gathered his knights together ... bringing from all the\\n| corners of the kingdom the strongest and bravest in the land ... To sit at\\n| The Round Table ...\\n|\\n| Under this voice over we have a montage of shots of ARTHUR recruiting his\\n| Knights:\\n|\\n| 1. ARTHUR, PATSY, BEDEVERE and PAGE riding through hillside.\\n| MIX TO:\\n|\\n| 2. A castle. LONG SHOT of SIR GAWAIN standing outside and ARTHUR\\'s group\\n| approaching and shaking hands perhaps.\\n|\\n| 3. MIX TO the group now plus SIR GAWAIN and PAGE (who is weighted down by an\\n| enormous quantity of luggage) riding down by a stream and approaching SIR\\n| HECTOR. ARTHUR dubs him.\\n|\\n| 4. MIX TO the group (now plus HECTOR and PAGE) approaching some group of\\n| buildings or whatever. In the distance SIR ROBIN is being taught the lute by\\n| one of his MUSICIANS. ARTHUR calls and SIR ROBIN immediately reacts and\\n| hands the lute to his MUSICIAN and comes to join ARTHUR & CO.\\n|\\n| 5. MIX TO SIR GALAHAD surrounded by chickens. He is wearing a carpenters\\n| apron over his immaculate armor and is finishing off a hen-house. We see the\\n| group approach and he throws off the apron and puts down the hen-house and\\n| goes to join them.\\n|\\n| 6. MIX TO the group riding along again.\\n|\\n| 7.

A large group of armored KNIGHTS are\\nengaged in a well choreographed song-and-dance routine of the very\\nup-beat \\'If they could see me now\\' type of fast bouncy number. The\\npoorer verses are made clearer by CUTTING to a group of knights\\nactually engaged in the described task while the line itself is\\nsung. They sing:\\n\\nKNIGHTS\\nWe\\'re knights of the round table\\nWe dance whene\\'er we\\'re able\\nWe do routines and chorus scenes\\nWith footwork impeccable.\\nWe dine well here in Camelot\\nWe eat ham and jam and spam a lot.\\n\\nWe\\'re knights of the Round Table\\nOur shows are formidable\\nBut many times\\nWe\\'re given rhymes\\nThat are quite unsingable\\nWe\\'re opera mad in Camelot\\nWe sing from the diaphragm a lot.\\n\\nBooming basses.

The PAGES, horselike, take\\nfright for a moment, they whinny and rattle their coconuts. ARTHUR and\\nthe KNIGHTS fall on their knees. A holy voice booms out.\\n\\nGOD\\nArthur! Arthur ... King of the Britons ...\\n\\nThey all prostrate themselves even further\\n\\nOh, don\\'t grovel ... do get up! If there\\'s one thing I can\\'t stand,\\nit\\'s people groveling!!\\n\\nARTHUR and COMPANY rise.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nSorry ...\\n\\nGOD \\nAnd don\\'t apologize.

Music crescendo as both lights fade.\\n\\nThat is your purpose Arthur ... the Quest for the Holy Grail ...\\n\\nIt is gone. All the KNIGHTS are left gasping in awe and\\nwonderment.

They advance\\nquite close to the castle and draw themselves into a line. At a signal\\nfrom ARTHUR the two PAGES step forward and give a brief fanfare.\\n\\nA MAN appears on the battlements. ARTHUR addresses him.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nHello.\\n\\nMAN\\n\\'Allo. Whoo is eet?\\n\\nARTHUR \\nI am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round\\nTable.

A faintly detectable squeaking\\nwhich is getting louder.\\n\\nCUT TO WIDE SHOT of castle and woodland. Squeaking getting\\nlouder. Shot of the FRENCH TAUNTER pointing. WIDE SHOT again. The\\nsqueaking gets louder an enormous twenty-foot-high wooden rabbit is\\nwheeled out of the undergrowth into the open space in front of the\\ncastle. The ENGLISH scuttle back into the undergrowth. The rabbit has\\na large red bow tied round it and a rather crudely written label,\\nwhich reads \"Pour votres amis Francais\". The CHIEF TAUNTER looks at\\nit, narrowing his eyes. Then he turns and leaves battlements.\\n\\nCUT TO ARTHUR and COMPANY watching from the bushes. The main gate of\\nthe castle opens a little and the CHIEF TAUNTER\\'s head sticks out,\\nthen another Froggie head, then another.

The ferocity of the French taunting took\\nhim completely by surprise and Arthur became convinced that a new\\nstrategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be\\nbrought to a successful conclusion. Arthur, having consulted his\\nclosest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the\\nGrail individually. Now, this is what they did. No sooner...\\n\\nA KNIGHT rides into shot and hacks him to the ground. He rides off.\\n\\nWe stay for a moment on the glade.

Progress is hard. He pauses and at this\\nmoment we hear the howling of wolves. GALAHAD turns, then hurries\\nonward even more urgently. Another louder, closer howl is herd and\\nGALAHAD stumbles and falls heavily. Though obviously injured he\\nbravely struggles forward a little and regains his feet reacting with\\npain. More louder closer howling. He grips his sword valiantly and as\\nhe glances around a flash of lightning reveals the silhouette of a\\nhuge terrifying castle, perhaps looking rather derelict. He makes up\\nhis mind in an instant and stumbles manfully toward it. More louder\\nhowling. He reaches the forbidding and enormous doors of the castle\\nand beats on the doors with the handle of his sword, looking over his\\nshoulder the while. Pause. He beats again, shouting:\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nOpen. Open the doors. In the name of King Arthur. Open the doors.\\n| I am Sir Galahad, a knight of the Round Table.\\n|\\n| Some suitable noises are herd inside.\\n|\\n| I am on a quest for the Holy Grail. I seek shelter.\\n\\nSome rattling chainy noises come from inside with huge bolts being\\ndrawn. The wolves\\' howling is very close. As the door creaks open\\nGALAHAD steps quickly inside.  15 INTERIOR - CASTLE - NIGHT\\n\\nFrom inside we see GALAHAD enter, wiping the rain from his eyes, and\\nturn as the door crashes behind him. GALAHAD turns to the door\\nreacting to the fact he is trapped.\\n\\nZOOT (OUT OF VISION)\\nHello!\\n\\nGALAHAD turns back. We see from his POV the lovely ZOOT standing by\\nhim smiling enchantingly and a number of equally delectable GIRLIES\\ndraped around in the seductively poulticed room. They look at him\\nsmilingly and wave.\\n\\nGIRLIES\\nHello!\\n\\nZOOT\\nWelcome, gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nThe Castle Anthrax?\\n\\nZOOT Yes. It\\'s not a very good name, is it? But we are nice and we\\nshall attend to your every ... every need!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nEr ...\\n+ You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?\\n\\nZOOT\\nThe what?

They are clearly on the verge of\\nbeing offended.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nWell ...\\n\\nZOOT \\n(she moves off and GALAHAD unwillingly follows) I\\'m afraid our\\nlife must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours. We are but\\neightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half,\\ncut off in this castle, with no one to protect us. Oooh. It is a\\nlonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making\\nexciting underwear....\\n\\nThey reach the end of the corridor and enter the bedchamber.\\nZOOT turns\\n\\nZOOT\\nWe are just not used to handsome knights ...\\n(she notices him limping)\\nBut you are wounded!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nNo, It\\'s nothing!\\n\\nZOOT\\nYou must see the doctors immediately.\\n(she claps again)\\nYou must lie down.\\n\\nShe almost forces him to lie on the bed as PIGLET and WINSTON enter\\nthe room. They are equally beautiful and dressed exotically. They\\napproach GALAHAD.\\n\\nPIGLET\\nWell, what seems to be the trouble?\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nThey\\'re doctors?\\n\\nZOOT \\nThey have a basic medical training, yes. Now you must try to\\nrest. Dr. Winston! Dr. Piglet! Practice your art!!\\n\\nWINSTON\\nTry to relax.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nNo look, really, this isn\\'t nescess ...\\n\\nPIGLET\\nWe must examine you.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nThere\\'s nothing wrong with ... that.\\n\\nPIGLET\\n(slightly irritated)\\nPlease ... we are doctors.\\n\\nZOOT reappears. GALAHAD tries for one brief moment to relax. Then\\nthere is a sharp boing from the lower part of his armor. WINSTON\\nglances quickly in the appropriate direction as GALAHAD sits up and\\nstarts getting off the bed and collecting his armor, saying:\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nNo, no, this cannot be. I am sworn to chastity!\\n\\nPIGLET\\nBack to your bed! At once!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nI\\'m sorry, I must go.\\n\\nGALAHAD hurries to the door and pushes through it. As he leaves the\\nroom we CUT TO the reverse to show that he is now in a room full of\\nbathing and romping GIRLIES, all innocent, wide-eyed and\\nbeautiful. They smile enchantingly at him as he tries to keep walking\\nwithout being diverted by the lovely sights assaulting his\\neyeballs. He nods to them stiffly once or twice and then his eye\\ncatches a particularly stunning YOUNG LADY. He visibly gulps with\\nrepressed emotion and cannot resist saying:\\n\\n|\\n| GALAHAD\\n| Good evening ... Ah, Zoot! Er ...\\n|\\n| DINGO\\n| No, I am Zoot\\'s identical twin sister, Dingo.\\n|\\n| GALAHAD\\n| Oh. Well, I\\'m sorry, but I must leave immediately.\\n|\\n| DINGO\\n| (very dramatically)\\n| No! Oh, no! Bad ... bad Zoot.\\n|\\n| GALAHAD\\n| Er, why?\\n|\\n| DINGO\\n| She has been lying again ... she told us you had promised to\\n| stay for ever!\\n|\\n| GALAHAD\\n| Oh!\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ Oh ... will you excuse me?\\n+\\n+ DINGO\\n+ Where are you going?\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ I have seen the Grail! I have seen it - here in this castle!\\n+\\n+ DINGO\\n+ No! Oh, no! Bad ... bad Zoot!\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ What is it?\\n+\\n+ DINGO\\n+ Bad, wicked, naughty Zoot! She has been setting fire to our beacon, which -\\n+ I have just remembered - is grail-shaped ... It is not the first time we\\'ve\\n+ had this problem.\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ It\\'s not the real Grail?\\n+\\n+\\n DINGO \\nWicked wicked Zoot ... she is a bad person and she must pay the\\npenalty. And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment\\n... you must tie her down on a bed ... and spank her. Come!\\n\\nGIRLS\\nA spanking! A spanking!\\n\\nDINGO \\nYou must spank her well and after you have spanked her you may\\ndeal with her as you like and then ... spank me.\\n\\nAMAZING\\nAnd spank me!\\n\\nSTUNNER\\nAnd me.\\n\\nLOVELY\\nAnd me.\\n\\nDINGO\\nYes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!\\n\\nGIRLS\\nA spanking. A spanking. There is going to be a spanking tonight.\\n\\nDINGO\\nAnd after the spanking ... the oral sex.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nOh, dear! Well, I...\\n\\nGIRLS\\nThe oral sex ... The oral sex.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nWell, I suppose I could stay a BIT longer.\\n\\nAt this moment there is a commotion behind and SIR LAUNCELOT and\\nCONCORD, possibly plus GAWAIN, burst into the bathing area with swords\\ndrawn and form themselves round SIR GALAHAD threatening the GIRLS.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nSir Galahad!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nOh ... hello ...\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nQuick!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nWhy?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nYou are in great peril.\\n\\nDINGO\\nNo he isn\\'t\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nSilence! Foul temptress!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nWell, she\\'s got a point.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nWe\\'ll cover your escape!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nLook - I\\'m fine!\\n\\nGIRLS\\nSir Galahad!\\n\\nHe threatens DINGO.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nNo. Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!\\n\\nGIRLS\\nYes, yes, let him Tackle us single-handed!\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nCome Sir Galahad, quickly!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nNo, really, I can cope. I can handle this lot easily!\\n\\nDINGO\\nYes, let him handle us easily.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nNo sir. Quick!\\n\\nHe starts pulling GALAHAD away.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nNo, please. Please! I can defeat them! There\\'s only a hundred.\\n\\nGIRLS\\nHe will beat us easily. We haven\\'t a chance.\\n\\nDINGO\\nOh shit!\\n\\nBy now LAUNCELOT and CONCORDE have hustled GALAHAD out of the bathing\\narea and are running through the outside door.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nWe were in the nick of time. You were in great peril.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\n(dragging his feet somewhat)\\nI don\\'t think I was.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nYou were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nLook, let me go back in there and face the peril?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nIt\\'s too perilous.\\n\\nThey are right outside the castle by now.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nLook, it\\'s my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nNo, no, we must find the Grail.\\n\\nThe thunderstorm is over. A bunch (sic) of PAGES are tethered to a\\ntree with more MEN waiting. Their tethers are untied and the PAGES\\nstart banging away with their coconuts. GALAHAD is swept along with\\nthem as they ride off.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nOh, let me go and have a bit of peril?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nNo. It\\'s unhealthy.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\n... I Bet you\\'re gay.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nNo, I\\'m not.\\n\\nGAWAIN or CONCORDE gives a knowing glance at LAUNCELOT. VOICE comes in as\\nthey ride off.\\n\\nVOICE OVER\\nSir Launcelot had saved Galahad from almost certain\\ntemptation but they were still lost, far from the goal of their search\\nfor the Holy Grail. Only Bedevere and King Arthur himself, riding day\\nand night, had made any progress.\\n\\n\\n16 ANIMATION/LIVE ACTION\\n\\nARTHUR and BEDEVERE in the depths of a dark forest with an old blind\\nSOOTHSAYER.

The Grail is there?\\n\\nThe BLIND MAN laughs again to himself.\\n\\nSOOTHSAYER \\nThere is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge\\nof Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nBut the Grail ... where is the Grail!?\\n\\nSOOTHSAYER\\nSeek you the Bridge of Death ...\\n\\nARTHUR\\nThe Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?\\n\\nThe OLD MAN laughs sinisterly and mockingly. They look down and he is\\ngone. They stand up. Suddenly behind them is a noise. They turn\\nsharply in the door of the little hut is a cat. It miaows and is\\ngone. They slowly back out of the hut. As they touch the doorposts\\nthey just flake away into dust. The whole hut is rotten. It collapses\\n\\nSpooky music. They are thoroughly shaken, and they begin to hear\\nnoises of people moving in the forest around them. They start to back\\ncautiously away from the hut, suddenly there is heavy footfall behind\\nthem. They turn in fear and:\\n\\nSudden CUT TO BIG CLOSE-UP of a frightening black-browed evil face.\\n\\nTALL KNIGHT OF NI\\nNi!\\n\\nARTHUR and BEDEVERE recoil in abject fear.

His WIFE, who has been\\nkneeling beside him, rises as two POLICE PATROLMEN enter the\\nglade. They bend over her HUSBAND. One takes out a notebook.\\n\\nCUT TO and animated title - \"The Tale of Sir Launcelot\"\\n\\n\\n18 INTERIOR - PRINCE\\'S ROOM IN CASTLE - DAY\\n\\nA young, quite embarrassingly unattractive PRINCE is gazing out of a\\ncastle window. His FATHER stands beside him. He is also looking\\nout. The PRINCE wears a long white undershirt (like a night shirt).\\n\\nFATHER\\nOne day, lad, all this will be yours ...\\n\\nPRINCE\\nWhat - the curtains?\\n\\nFATHER\\nNo! Not the curtains, lad ... All that ...\\n(indicates the vista from the window)\\nall that you can see, stretched out over the hills and\\nvalleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ...\\nthat\\'ll be your kingdom, lad.\\n\\nPRINCE\\nBut, Mother ...\\n\\nFATHER\\nFather, lad.\\n\\nPRINCE\\nBut, Father, I don\\'t really want any of that.\\n\\nFATHER\\nListen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing. All I had when I\\nstarted was swamp ... other kings said I was daft to build a castle on\\na swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show \\'em. It sank\\ninto the swamp. So I built a another one ... that sank into the\\nswamp. I built another one ... That fell over and THEN sank into the\\nswamp .... So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that\\'s\\nwhat your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.\\n\\nPRINCE\\nBut I don\\'t want any of that, I\\'d rather ...\\n\\nFATHER\\nRather what?\\n\\nPRINCE\\nI\\'d rather ... just ... sing ...\\n\\nMUSIC INTRO\\n\\nFATHER\\nYou\\'re not going to do a song while I\\'m here!\\n\\nMusic stops.\\n\\nListen, lad, in twenty minutes you\\'re going to be married to a girl\\nwhose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.\\n\\nPRINCE\\nI don\\'t want land.\\n\\nFATHER\\nListen, Alice ...\\n\\nPRINCE\\nHerbert.\\n\\nFATHER\\nHerbert ... We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we\\ncan get.\\n\\nPRINCE\\nBut I don\\'t like her.\\n\\nFATHER \\nDon\\'t like her? What\\'s wrong with her? She\\'s beautiful\\n... she\\'s rich ... she\\'s got huge tracts of land ...\\n\\nPRINCE \\nI know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to have ... a\\ncertain ... special ... something ...\\n\\nMUSIC INTO FOR song.\\n\\nFATHER\\nCut that out!\\n\\nMusic cuts off abruptly.\\n\\nYou\\'re marrying Princess Lucky, so you\\'d better get used to the idea! Guards!\\n\\nTWO GUARDS enter and stand to attention on either side of the door\\nOne of them has hiccoughs and does so throughout.\\n\\nFATHER\\nMake sure the Prince doesn\\'t leave this room until I come and get him.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nNot ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.\\n\\nFATHER\\nNo. Until I come and get him.\\n\\nSECOND GUARD\\nHic.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nUntil you come and get him, we\\'re not to enter the room.\\n\\nFATHER\\nNo ... You stay in the room and make sure he doesn\\'t leave.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\n... and you\\'ll come and get him.\\n\\nSECOND GUARD\\nHic.\\n\\nFATHER\\nThat\\'s Right.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nWe don\\'t need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.\\n\\nFATHER\\nLeaving the room.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nLeaving the room ... yes.\\n\\nFATHER\\nGot it?\\n\\nSECOND GUARD\\nHic.\\n\\nFARTHER makes to leave.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nEr ... if ... we ... er ...\\n\\nFATHER\\nYes?\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nIf we ... er ...\\n(trying to remember what he was going to say)\\n\\nFATHER\\nLook, it\\'s simple. Just stay here and make sure he doesn\\'t leave the room.\\n\\nSECOND GUARD\\nHic.\\n\\nFATHER\\nRight?\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nOh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?\\n\\nFATHER\\n(carefully)\\nNo .... keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn\\'t ...\\n\\nFIRST GUARD \\nOh, yes! we\\'ll keep him in here, obviously. But if he had\\nto leave and we were with him.\\n\\nFATHER\\nNo ... just keep him in here.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nUntil you, or anyone else ...\\n\\nFATHER\\nNo, not anyone else - just me.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nJust you ...\\n\\nSECOND GUARD\\nHic.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nGet back.\\n\\nFATHER\\nRight.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nOkay. Fine. We\\'ll remain here until you get back.\\n\\nFATHER\\nAnd make sure he doesn\\'t leave.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nWhat?\\n\\nFATHER\\nMake sure he doesn\\'t leave.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nThe Prince ... ?\\n\\nFATHER\\nYes ... make sure ...\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nOh yes, of course! I thought you meant him!\\n(he points to the other GUARD and laughs to himself)\\nYou know it seemed a bit daft me havin\\' to guard him when he\\'s a guard ...\\n\\nFATHER\\nIs that clear?\\n\\nSECOND GUARD\\nHic.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nOh, yes. That\\'s quite clear. No problems.\\n\\nFATHER pulls open the door and makes to leave the room. The GUARDS follow.\\n\\nFATHER\\n(to the GUARDS)\\nWhere are you going?\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nWe\\'re coming with you.\\n\\nFATHER \\nNo, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn\\'t leave the\\nroom until I get back.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nOh, I see, Right.\\n\\nThey take up positions on either side of the door.\\n\\nPRINCE\\nBut, Father.\\n\\nFATHER\\nShut your noise, you, and get that suit on!\\n\\nHe points to a wedding suit on a table or chair. FATHER throws one\\nlast look at the BOY and turns, goes out and slams the door.\\n\\nThe PRINCE slumps onto window seat, looking forlornly out of the\\nwindow. MUSIC INTRO to song ...\\n\\nThe door flies open, the music cuts off and FATHER pokes his head in.\\n\\nFATHER\\nAnd no singing!\\n\\nSECOND GUARD\\nHic.\\n\\nFATHER\\n(as he goes out.)\\nGo and have a drink of water.\\n\\nFATHER slams the door again. The GUARDS take up their positions. The\\nSON gazes out of the window again ... sighs ... thinks ... a thought\\nstrikes him ... he gets up, crosses to his desk and scribbles a quick\\nnote and impales it on an arrow ... takes a bow down from the wall\\n... and fires the arrow out of the window.\\n\\nHe looks wetly defiant at the GUARDS, who smile pleasantly.\\n\\n\\n15 EXTERIOR - A FOREST - DAY\\n\\nCUT TO the middle of the forest. SIR LAUNCELOT is riding along with a\\ntrusty servant, CONCORDE.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nAnd ... o v e r ... we go!\\n\\nHe strides over a big tree trunk ... his \"horse\" does run and jump ...\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\n(enthusiastically)\\nWell taken, Concorde!\\n\\nCONCORDE\\nThank you, sir, most kind ...\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nAnd another!\\n\\nCONCORDE misses a beat.\\n\\nSteady! Good ... and the last one ...\\n\\nCONCORDE does the run-up with the coconuts. He does the break for the\\nleap ... there is a thwack. SIR LAUNCELOT is waiting for the horse to\\nland.\\n\\nCONCORDE\\nMessage for you, sir.\\n\\nHe falls forward revealing the arrow with the note.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nConcorde - speak to me.\\n\\nHe realizes he might be in danger and so starts to crawl off ... when\\nhe notices the note. He takes it out and reads it.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT \\n(reading) \"To whoever finds this note - I have been\\nimprisoned by my father who wishes me to marry against my will. Please\\nplease please please come and rescue me. I am in the tall tower of\\nSwamp Castle.\"\\n\\nSIR LAUNCELOT\\'s eyes light up with holy inspiration.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nAt last! A call! A cry of distress ...\\n(he draws his sword, and turns to CONCORDE)\\nConcorde! Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!\\n\\nCONCORDE\\nI\\'m not quite dead, sir ...\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\n(a little deflated)\\nOh, well ... er brave Concorde! You shall not have been fatally\\nwounded in vain!\\n\\nCONCORDE\\nI think I could pull through, sir.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nGood Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.\\n\\nHe makes to leap off dramatically.\\n\\nCONCORDE\\nI think I\\'ll be all right to come with you, sir.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT \\nI will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have\\naccomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.\\n\\nCONCORDE\\nReally, I feel fine, sir.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nFarewell, Concorde!\\n\\nCONCORDE\\nIt just seems silly ... me lying here.\\n\\nSIR LAUNCELOT plunges off into the forest.\\n\\n20 EXTERIOR - CASTLE GATEWAY - DAY\\n\\nTwo hanging banners one each side of the gate with the monogram: \"H & L\".\\n\\nTWO SENTRIES with spears ... slightly weddingly ... red ribbons on\\ntheir right spears. We can hear from inside revelry and celebration\\nmusic.\\n\\nWe hear LAUNCELOT\\'s footsteps. The TWO SENTRIES are watching him. One\\nof them raises his hand.\\n\\n|\\n| FIRST SENTRY\\n| Halt, friend ...\\n|\\n\\nLAUNCELOT leaps into SHOT with a mighty cry and runs the GUARD through\\nand hacks him to the floor. Blood. Swashbuckling music\\n(perhaps). LAUNCELOT races through into the castle screaming.\\n\\nSECOND SENTRY\\nHey!\\n\\nHe looks down at his mutilated comrade.\\n\\n\\n21 EXTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nCUT TO inside of the castle grounds or courtyard.\\n\\nin the sunlight beautifully dressed WEDDING GUESTS are\\narriving. Converging on a doorway. A country dance in progress.\\n\\nSIR LAUNCELOT rushes towards them.\\n\\nCUT TO HAND-HELD CLOSE-UPS as he charges through the crowd, hacking\\nright and left a la Errol Flynn at all who come in his way.\\n\\nHe fights his way through the country dance. Blood. Shrieks. Bemused\\nlooks of GUESTS - not horror so much as uncomprehending surprise.\\n\\nPossibly Errol Flynn music.\\n\\nOne COUNTRY DANCER is left holding just a hand.\\n\\nRight and left the GUESTS crumple in pools of blood as he fights his\\nway through the door and into the main hall.\\n\\n\\n22 INTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nCUT TO interior of main hall. Sound of busy preparations. MEN setting\\nup huge hogsheads of wine. MEN putting up last minute flower\\narrangements. COOKS bearing huge trays of food, pies, suckling pigs, a\\nswan, boar\\'s head, etc.\\n\\nThe BRIDE being dressed by several ATTENDANTS. FATHER ordering\\nSERVANTS around - organizing the STEWARDS etc.\\n\\nSIR LAUNCELOT bursts through the middle of them, slashing heroically,\\nhacking, wounding and killing. Again fairly CLOSE-UP chaotic SHOTS. We\\nsee GUESTS stagger back wounded - a COOK bites the dust, etc.\\n\\nSIR LAUNCELOT eventually reaches the staircase ... runs up it and into\\na small door.\\n\\n\\n23 INTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nCUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT running up spiral staircase. He reaches the door\\nof the PRINCE\\'s room. he flings it open.\\n\\nFIRST GUARD\\nAh! Now ... we\\'re not allowed to ...\\n\\nSIR LAUNCELOT runs him through, grabs his spear and stabs the other\\nguard who collapses in a heap. Hiccoughs quietly.\\n\\nSIR LAUNCELOT runs to the window and kneels down in front of the\\nPRINCE, averting his head.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nOh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the\\nCourt of Camelot. I have come to take you ...  (he looks up for the\\nfirst time and his voice trails away) away ... I\\'m terribly sorry ...\\n\\nPRINCE\\nYou got my note!\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nWell ... yes ...\\n\\nPRINCE\\nYou\\'ve come to rescue me?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nWell ... yes ... but I hadn\\'t realized ...\\n\\nPRINCE\\n(his eyes light up)\\nI knew that someone would come. I knew ... somewhere out there\\n... there must be ...\\n\\nMUSIC INTRO to song.\\n\\nFATHER\\n(suddenly looking in the door)\\nStop that!\\n\\nMusic cuts out.\\n\\nFATHER sees SIR LAUNCELOT still kneeling before his son.\\n\\nFATHER\\nWho are you?\\n\\nPRINCE\\nI\\'m ... your son ...\\n\\nFATHER\\nNot you.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\n(half standing self-consciously)\\nI\\'m ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.\\n\\nPRINCE\\nHe\\'s come to rescue me, father.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\n(embarrassed)\\nWell, let\\'s not jump to conclusions ...\\n\\nFATHER\\nDid you kill all those guards?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nYes ... I\\'m very sorry ...\\n\\nFATHER\\nThey cost fifty pounds each!\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nWell, I\\'m really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...\\n\\nPRINCE\\nDon\\'t be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot. I\\'ve got a rope here all ready ...\\n\\nHe throws a rope out of the window which is tied to a pillar in the\\nroom. He looks rather pleased with himself that he has got it all\\nready.\\n\\nFATHER\\nYou killed eight wedding guests in all!\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nEr, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.\\n\\nFATHER\\nI can understand that.\\n\\nPRINCE\\n(half out of the window)\\nHurry, brave Sir Launcelot!\\n\\nFATHER\\n(to his SON)\\nShut up!\\n(to LAUNCELOT)\\nYou only killed the bride\\'s father - that\\'s all -\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nOh dear, I didn\\'t really mean to...\\n\\nFATHER\\nDidn\\'t mean to? You put your sword right through his head!\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nGosh - Is he all right?\\n\\nFATHER\\nYou even kicked the bride in the chest! It\\'s going to cost me a fortune!\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nI can explain ... I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot\\n... when I got this note.\\n\\nFATHER\\nCamelot? Are you from Camelot?\\n\\nThe PRINCE\\'s head peeps over the windowsill.\\n\\nPRINCE\\nHurry!\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nI am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.\\n\\nFATHER\\n\\'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nIs it?\\n\\nPRINCE (out of vision)\\nI am ready, Sir Launcelot.\\n\\nFATHER\\nDo you want to come and have a drink?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nOh ... that\\'s awfully nice.\\n\\nPRINCE (OOV)\\n(loud and shrill)\\nI am ready!\\n\\nAs they walk past the rope, the FATHER nonchalantly cuts with his\\nknife. There is no sound except after a pause a slight squeal from\\nvery far away as the PRINCE makes contact with the ground.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nIt\\'s just that when I\\'m in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and\\nstart to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...\\n\\nFATHER\\nOh, don\\'t worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn\\'t Camelot own that\\nstretch of farmland up by the mountains?\\n\\nHe puts his arm round LAUNCELOT\\'s shoulders as they go though the door.\\n\\n\\n24 INTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nCUT TO the great hall. GUESTS wounded and bloody, are tending to the\\ndead and injured, sighs and groans, the PRINCESS in her white wedding\\ndress is holding her chest and coughing blood. People dabbing the\\nstains off her dress.\\n\\nFATHER and SIR LAUNCELOT start to walk down the grand\\nstaircase. Talking to each other.\\n\\nOne of the GUESTS notices and points to SIR LAUNCELOT.\\n\\nGUEST\\nThere he is!\\n\\nAs one man all remaining able-bodied MEN look up and make for the\\nstaircase, muttering angrily. SIR LAUNCELOT grabs his sword.\\n\\nFATHER\\nHold it!\\n\\nBut it is too lake. SIR LAUNCELOT cannot be stopped. With fearless\\nabandon he throws himself into the CROWD and starts hacking and\\nslashing. He has carved quite a number up before the FATHER can stop\\nhim and pulls him back onto the stairs. Renewed groans and cries.\\n\\n\\nFATHER\\n(shouting above noise)\\nHold it! Please!\\nLAUNCELOT\\nSorry! Sorry ...\\n(with bitter self reproach)\\nThere you See ... I just got excited again and I got carried away\\n... I\\'m ever so sorry.\\n(to the CROWD)\\nSorry.\\n\\nCROWD kneeling round their wounded again. Moans etc.\\n\\nGUEST\\nHe\\'s killed the best man!\\n\\nSECOND GUEST\\n(holding a limp WOMAN)\\nHe\\'s killed my auntie.\\n\\nFATHER\\nNo, please! This is supposed to be a happy occasion! Let\\'s not bicker\\nand argue about who killed who ... We are here today to witness the\\nunion of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy\\nwedlock.

Spring\\nchanged back into Autumn and Autumn gave Winter and Spring a miss and\\nwent straight on into Summer ... Until one day ...\\n\\n\\n30 EXTERIOR - WASTES - DAY\\n\\nThe KNIGHTS are riding along the top of a ridge. The country is wild\\nand inhospitable. Suddenly some of them see fire in the distance and\\nride towards it. As they approach they see an impressive WIZARD figure\\nstriding around conjuring up fire from the ground and causing various\\nbushes and branches to burst into flame.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?\\n\\nTIM\\nI am an enchanter.\\n\\nARTHUR looks at BEDEVERE.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nBy what name are you known?\\n\\nTIM\\nThere are some who call me Tim?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nGreetings Tim the Enchanter!\\n\\nTIM\\nGreetings King Arthur.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou know my name?\\n\\nTIM\\nI do.\\n(does another fire trick)\\nYou seek the Holy Grail.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nThat is our quest. You know much that is hidden O Tim.\\n\\nTIM\\n(does another fire trick)\\nQuite.\\n\\nRipple of applause from the KNIGHTS.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYes we seek the Holy Grail.\\n(clears throat very quietly)\\nOur quest is to find the Holy Grail.\\n\\nONE OR TWO KNIGHTS\\nYes it is.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nAnd so we\\'re looking for it.\\n\\nKNIGHTS\\nYes, we are.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nWe have been for some time.\\n\\nKNIGHTS\\nYes.\\n\\nROBIN\\nMonths.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYes ... and obviously any help we get is ... is very ... helpful.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nDo you know where it ...\\n\\nTIM does another fire trick.\\n\\nALL OTHER KNIGHTS\\nSsssh!\\n\\nARTHUR\\nFine ... well er ... we mustn\\'t take up anymore of your time ... I\\ndon\\'t suppose ... sorry to sort of keep on about it ... you haven\\'t by\\nany chance ... aaah ... any idea where one might find ... a ... aaa\\n...\\n\\nTIM\\nWhat?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nA G...g...g...\\n\\nTIM\\nA Grail?\\n\\nThey all jump slightly and look about apprehensively.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nEr ... yes ... I think so.\\n\\nALL OTHER KNIGHTS\\nYes.\\n\\nTIM\\nYes.\\n\\nKNIGHTS\\nFine.\\n\\nROBIN\\nSplendid!\\n\\nOTHERS\\nYes, marvelous.\\n\\nTIM looks thoughtful and they all stand around a little. Then TIM produces\\nanother fire trick producing several different colors.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nLook, you\\'re a busy man ...\\n\\nTIM\\nYes, I can help you with your guest.\\n\\nSlight pause.\\n\\nALL OTHER KNIGHTS\\nThank you. Yes, thank you very much.\\n\\nTIM\\nTo the north there lies a cave, the cave of Caerbannog, wherein,\\ncarved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock, the last words of\\nOlfin Bedwere of Rheged ...\\n\\nThere is a thunderclap and a wind starts. They KNIGHTS get nervous.\\n\\nTIM\\n... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nHow shall we find this cave, O Tim?\\n\\nTIM\\nFollow!\\n\\nThe KNIGHTS register delight and wheel round on themselves.\\n\\nBut follow only if you are men of valor. For the entrance to this cave\\nis guarded by a monster, a creature so foul and cruel that no man yet\\nhas fought with it and lived. Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about\\nits lair ... therefore sweet knights if you may doubt your strength or\\ncourage come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty pointy\\nteeth.\\n\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ What an eccentric performance!\\n+\\n\\n31 EXTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nCUT TO impressive rock face with caves in it. The KNIGHTS are \\'riding\\'\\ntowards it. A foreboding atmosphere supervenes. TIM gives a signal for\\nquietness. ARTHUR shushes the \\'horses\\'.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nShhh!\\n\\nThe PAGES decrease the amount of noise they are making with the\\ncoconuts for a few seconds. Then there is a burst of noise from them\\nincluding whinnying.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\n(to ARTHUR)\\nThey\\'re nervous, sire.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nThen we\\'d best leave them here and carry on on foot.\\n\\nTIM takes a strange look at them. They walk on leaving the PAGES\\nbehind. After a few more strides TIM halts them with a sign.\\n\\nTIM\\nBehold the Cave of Caerbannog!\\n\\nCUT TO shot of cave. Bones littered around. The KNIGHTS get the wind\\nup partially. A little dry ice, glowing green can be seen at the\\nentrance. Suddenly we become aware of total silence. Any noises the\\nKNIGHTS make sound very exaggerated. They unsheathe their swords.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nKeep me covered.\\n\\nStir among KNIGHTS.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nWhat with?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nJust keep me covered.\\n\\nTIM\\nToo late.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat?\\n\\nTIM\\nThere he is!\\n\\nThey all turn,, and see a large white RABBIT lollop a few yards out of\\nthe cave. Accompanied by terrifying chord and jarring metallic monster\\nnoise.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhere?\\n\\nTIM\\nThere.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nBehind the rabbit?\\n\\nTIM\\nIt is the rabbit.\\n\\nARTHUR\\n... You silly sod.\\n\\nTIM\\nWhat?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nYou got us all worked up.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nYou cretin!\\n\\nTIM\\nThat is not an ordinary rabbit ... \\'tis the most foul cruel and\\nbad-tempered thing you ever set eyes on.\\n\\nROBIN\\nYou tit. I soiled my armor I was so scared!\\n\\nTIM\\nThat rabbit\\'s got a vicious streak. It\\'s a killer!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\n| Oh, fuck off.\\n+ Get stuffed.\\n\\nTIM\\nHe\\'ll do you up a treat mate!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nOh yeah?\\n\\nROBIN\\n| You turd!\\n+ Mangy scots git!\\n\\nTIM\\nLook. I\\'m warning you.\\n\\nROBIN\\nWhat\\'s he do? Nibble your bum?\\n\\nTIM\\nWell, It\\'s got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nGo on, Bors, chop its head off.\\n\\nBORS\\nRight. Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew coming up.\\n\\nTIM\\nLook!\\n\\nAs TIM points they all spin round to see the RABBIT leap at BORS\\'\\nthroat with an appalling scream. From a distance of about twenty feet\\nthere is a tin opening noise, a cry from BORS. A quick CLOSE-UP of a\\nsavage RABBIT biting through tin and BORS\\' head flies off. The RABBIT\\nleaps back to the mouth of the cave and sits there looking in the\\nKNIGHTS\\' direction and growling menacingly.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nJe...sus Christ!\\n\\nTIM\\nI warned you!\\n\\nROBIN\\nI done it again.\\n\\nTIM\\nDid I tell you? Did you listen to me? Oh no, no, you knew better\\ndidn\\'t you? No, it\\'s just an ordinary rabbit isn\\'t it. The names you\\ncalled me. Well, don\\'t say I didn\\'t tell you.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nOh, shut up.\\n\\nTIM\\n(quietly)\\nIt\\'s always the same ... if I\\'ve said it once.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nCharge!\\n\\nTy all charge with swords drawn towards the RABBIT. A tremendous\\ntwenty second fight with Peckinpahish shots and borrowing heavily also\\non the Kung Fu and karate-type films ensues, in which some four\\nKNIGHTS are comprehensively killed.\\n\\nRun away! Run away!\\n\\nALL KNIGHTS\\n(taking up cry)\\nRun away! Run away!\\n\\nThey run down from the cave and hide, regrouping behind some\\nrocks. TIM, some way away, is pointing at them and laughing\\nderisively.\\n\\nTIM\\nHa ha ha. Ha ha ha.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWho did we lose?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nSir Gawain.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nEctor.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nAnd Bors. Five.\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ Three, sir!\\n+\\nARTHUR\\nThree. Well, we\\'ll not risk another frontal assault. That rabbit\\'s dynamite.\\n\\nROBIN\\nWould it help to confuse him if we ran away more.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nShut up. Go and change your armor.\\n\\nROBIN leaves, walking strangely.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nLet us taunt it. It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nLike what?\\n\\nGALAHAD cannot find a suitable answer to this.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nDo we have any bows?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nNo.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nWe have the Holy Hand Grenade.\\n\\nROBIN\\nThe what?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nThe Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. \\'Tis one of the sacred relics\\nBrother Maynard always carries with him.\\n\\nALL\\nYes. Of course.\\n\\nARTHUR\\n(shouting)\\nBring up the Holy Hand Grenade!\\n\\nSlight pause. Then from the area where the \\'HORSES\\' are, a small group\\nof MONKS process forward towards the KNIGHTS, the leading MONK bearing\\nand ornate golden reliquary, and the accompanying MONKS chanting and\\nwaving incense. They reach the KNIGHTS. The hand grenade is suffused\\nwith the holy glow.\\n\\nARTHUR takes it. Pause\\n\\nARTHUR\\nHow does it ... er ...\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nI know not.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nConsult the Book of Armaments.\\n\\nBROTHER MAYNARD\\nArmaments Chapter Two Verses Nine to Twenty One.\\n\\nANOTHER MONK\\n(reading from bible)\\nAnd St. Attila raised his hand grenade up on high saying \"O Lord bless\\nthis thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow thine enemies to\\ntiny bits, in thy mercy. \"and the Lord did grin and people did feast\\nupon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orang-utans and\\nbreakfast cereals and fruit bats and...\\n\\nBROTHER MAYNARD\\nSkip a bit brother ...\\n\\nANOTHER MONK\\n... Er ... oh, yes ... and the Lord spake, saying, \"First shalt thou\\ntake out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count to three, no more, no\\nless. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of\\nthe counting shalt be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count\\nthou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right\\nout. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then\\nlobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thou foe, who\\nbeing naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nRight.\\n\\nHe pulls Pin out. The MONK blesses the grenade as ...\\n\\nARTHUR\\n(quietly)\\nOne, two\\n| , three ...\\n+ , five ...\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ Three, sir!\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ Three.\\n+\\n\\nARTHUR throws the grenade at the RABBIT. There is an explosion and\\ncheering from the KNIGHTS.\\n\\nALL KNIGHTS\\nPraise be to the lord. Huzzah!\\n\\n32 INTERIOR - CAVE - DAY\\n\\nMIX THROUGH TO the KNIGHTS entering the cave. It is a large cave and\\nas they walk inside it we see in the darkness at the side of the cave\\na fearsome looking CREATURE which watches them with some surprise as\\nthey walk to some writing carved on the back of the cave wall. The\\nKNIGHTS are accompanied by BROTHER MAYNARD.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nThere! Look!\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nWhat does it say?\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nWhat language is this?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nBrother Maynard, you are a scholar.\\n\\nBROTHER MAYNARD\\nIt is Aramaic!\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nOf course. Joseph of Aramathea!\\n\\nALL\\nOf course.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat does it say?\\n\\nBROTHER MAYNARD\\nIt reads ... \"Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Aramathea.\"\\n\\nExcitement.\\n\\n\"He who is valorous and pure of heart may find the Holy Grail in the\\naaaaarrrrrrggghhh...\"\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat?\\n\\nBROTHER MAYNARD\\n\"The Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh...\"\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nWhat\\'s that?\\n\\nBROTHER MAYNARD\\nHe must have died while carving it.\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nOh, come on.\\n\\nBROTHER MAYNARD\\nThat\\'s what it says.\\n\\nARTHUR\\n(miming)\\nBut if he was dying, he wouldn\\'t bother to carve\\n\"Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh\". He\\'d just say it.\\n\\nBROTHER MAYNARD\\nIt\\'s down there carved in stone.\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nPerhaps he was dictating.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nShut up. Is that all it says?\\n\\nBROTHER MAYNARD\\nThat\\'s all. \"Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh\".\\n\\nARTHUR\\n\"Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh\".\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nDo you think he meant the Camargue?\\n\\nGALAHAD\\nWhere\\'s that?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nFrance, I think.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nIsn\\'t there a St. Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh\\'s in Cornwall?\\n\\nARTHUR\\nNo, that\\'s Saint Ives.\\n\\nA muffled roar is heard.\\n|\\n| ROBIN\\n| Hey!\\n|\\n| BEDEVERE\\n| No, that\\'s in Herefordshire.\\n|\\n| ROBIN\\n| (more urgently)\\n| No ... HEY!!!\\n|\\n| LAUNCELOT\\n| \"Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... \"\\n|\\n| ROBIN\\n| No! \"Hey\"! is surprise and alarm!\\n+\\n+ BEDEVERE\\n+ Oooooh!\\n+\\n+ LAUNCELOT\\n+ No \"Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... \" at the back of the throat.\\n+\\n+ BEDEVERE\\n+ No! \"Oooooh!\" in surprise and alarm!\\n+\\n\\nHe indicated the entrance of the cave. They all turn and look. There\\nin the opening is a huge, unpleasant, fairly well drawn cartoon\\nbeast.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nOh!\\nGALAHAD\\nMy God!\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nWhat is it?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nI know! I know! I Know!\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nIt\\'s the ... oh ...\\n(snaps his fingers as he tries to remember)\\nit\\'s the ... it\\'s on the tip of my tongue ...\\n\\nAnother hideous roar.\\n\\nThat\\'s it!\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat?\\n\\nBEDEVERE\\nIt\\'s The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!\\n|\\n| At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION. ARTHUR turns.\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| Who was that?\\n|\\n| HECTOR\\n| (from back of group; northern and helpful)\\n| It was Sir Alf.\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| I didn\\'t know we had a Sir Alf.\\n|\\n| HECTOR\\n| He was feeding it bread.\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| (shouting back)\\n| Well, that was a very silly thing to do. Now the rest of you stand\\n| well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!\\n|\\n| HECTOR\\n| Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!\\n|\\n| ROBIN\\n| Look out.\\n|\\n| The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them. The KNIGHTS retreat\\n| into the darkness of the cave.\\n|\\n| GAWAIN\\n| (as they run)\\n| It\\'s only a cartoon.\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| Sh!\\n\\nThey run off. Darkness. The MONSTER lumbering through on animation.\\n\\n+ VOICE OVER\\n+ As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur and his\\n+ knights seemed hopeless, when, suddenly ... the animator suffered a fatal\\n+ heart attack.\\n+\\n+ ANIMATOR\\n+ Aaaaagh!\\n+\\n+ VOICE OVER\\n+ The cartoon peril was no more ... The Quest for Holy Grail could continue.\\n\\nANIMATED SEQUENCE. Leads through to the group reappearing and seeing a\\ndistant opening to the cave. They reach the opening. It is day.\\n33 EXTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nThe KNIGHTS emerge from the mouth of the cave to find themselves in a\\nbreathtaking, barren landscape. Glencoe. They are half they way up the\\nside of a mountain. They rest a few seconds and get their breath\\nback.\\n\\n|\\n| GALAHAD\\n| Look!\\n|\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ There it is!\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ The Bridge of Death!\\n+\\n+ ROBIN\\n+ (to himself)\\n+ Oh! Great ...\\n|\\n| They look and see on the side of the mountain there is a sort of milestone\\n| which bears the words: \"Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 5 miles\" and an arrow.\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| God be praised. This must be the gorge of which the old man spoke in scene\\n| twenty-four.\\n|\\n| The KNIGHTS set off along and rather perilous track edging along\\n| the side of the mountain. GALAHAD is leading.\\n|\\n| MIX THROUGH they are climbing higher. The path gets more and more slippery\\n| and dangerous. They reach another milestone which says: \"Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!\\n| 4 miles\" and an arrow, and \"Ni! 82 miles\" and an arrow pointing in the\\n| opposite direction. They go on. It is dangerous and difficult. Tension in\\n| their faces.\\n|\\n| As they are climbing, BEDEVERE turns to ROBIN and ARTHUR.\\n|\\n| BEDEVERE\\n| We must find the bridge ... the Bridge of Death ...\\n|\\n| ROBIN\\n| (to himself)\\n| Oh, great!\\n|\\n| BEDEVERE\\n| The Bridge is guarded by a bridgekeeper, who asks each traveler three\\n| questions. And he who answers the three questions can cross in safety.\\n|\\n| ROBIN\\n| (warily)\\n| And if you get a question wrong?\\n|\\n| BEDEVERE\\n| You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.\\n|\\n|34 EXTERIOR - DAY\\n|\\n| CUT TO them struggling along. Perhaps downhill now. It is growing misty.\\n| SIR LAUNCELOT stops them and points. They peer.\\n|\\n| CUT TO see in the mist ... a weird bridge with mist swirling up from the\\n| gorge below. We cannot see the other side.\\n|\\n| Beside the bridge an OLD MAN stands, he is the blind soothsayer they met\\n| earlier in the forest.\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| (to BEDEVERE)\\n| He\\'s the Keeper of the Bridge. It\\'s the old man.\\n|\\n| BEDEVERE\\n| (swallowing hard)\\n| Who\\'s going to answer the questions?\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| You go, Robin, and God be with you.\\n|\\n| ROBIN\\n| (looking round wildly)\\n| Er ... I tell you what -\\n| (lowering voice)\\n| Why doesn\\'t Launcelot go?\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| (considering a moment)\\n| Very well ... Sir Launcelot. Brave Sir Launcelot. This is the Bridge of\\n| Death ...\\n|\\n| LAUNCELOT\\n| Oh, yes sir ... I will take it single-handed.\\n| (drawing his sword)\\n| I will ...\\n|\\n| ARTHUR restrains him.\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| No, hang on. All we want is for you to approach the old man and he will ask\\n| you three questions. Answer those question as best you can, and we will\\n| watch ... and pray.\\n|\\n| LAUNCELOT\\n| Yes, my liege ...\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot! Be careful ...\\n|\\n| They shake hands, Arthur\\'s eyes moisten. LAUNCELOT approaches the Bridge of\\n| Death.\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| Listen to the questions.\\n+\\n+ BEDEVERE\\n+ Look! It\\'s the old man from scene 24 - what\\'s he Doing here?\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ He is the keeper of the Bridge. He asks each traveler five questions ...\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ Three questions.\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ Three questions ... he who answers the five questions\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ Three questions.\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ Three questions, may cross in safety.\\n+\\n+ ROBIN\\n+ (warily)\\n+ And if you get a question wrong?\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.\\n+\\n+ ROBIN\\n+ Oh ... wacho!\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ Who\\'s going to answer the questions?\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ Sir Robin, Brave Sir Robin you go.\\n+\\n+ ROBIN\\n+ Hey! I\\'ve got a great idea! Why doesn\\'t Launcelot go?\\n+\\n+ LAUNCELOT\\n+ Yes. Let me. I will take it single-handed ...\\n+ I will make feint to the north-east ...\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ No, hang on! Just answer the five questions ...\\n+\\n+ GALAHAD\\n+ Three questions ...\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ Three questions ... And we shall watch ... and pray.\\n+\\n+ LAUNCELOT\\n+ I understand, my liege.\\n+\\n+ ARTHUR\\n+ Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot ... God be with you.\\n+\\n+ LAUNCELOT APPROACHES THE BRIDGEKEEPER.\\n+\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nStop!\\n\\nSIR LAUNCELOT stops. The KNIGHTS watch anxiously. ARTHUR sniffs briefly\\nand glances momentarily down at SIR ROBIN\\'s lower armor.\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nWho approaches the Bridge of Death\\nMust answer me\\nThese questions three!\\nEre the other side he see.\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nAsk me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nWhat is your name?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nMy name is Sir Launcelot.\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nWhat is your quest?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nTo find the Holy Grail.\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nWhat is your favorite color?\\n\\nLAUNCELOT\\nBlue.\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nRight. Off you go.\\n\\nSIR LAUNCELOT runs across into the mist. The bridge perhaps disappears\\ninto the mist and we cannot see the other side. ARTHUR and SIR ROBIN\\nexchange glances. ROBIN breathes a great sigh of relief.\\n\\nROBIN\\nThat\\'s easy!\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nStop!\\nWho approacheth the Bridge of Death\\nMust answer me\\nThese questions three!\\nEre the other side he see!\\n\\nROBIN\\nAsk me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nWhat is your name?\\n\\nROBIN\\nMy name is Sir Robin of Camelot!\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nWhat is your quest?\\n\\nROBIN\\nTo seek the Grail!\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER\\nWhat is the capital of Assyria?\\n\\nROBIN\\n(indignantly)\\nI don\\'t know that!\\n\\nHe is immediately hurled by some unseen force over the edge of the precipice.\\n\\nROBIN\\nAaaaarrrrrrggghhh!\\n\\n\\n35 EXTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nCUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT who is only just arriving on the other side. He\\nlooks back across the invisible chasm. Dimly in the distance he hears:\\n\\nGAWAIN (OUT OF VISION)\\nSir Gawain of Camelot!\\n\\nBRIDGEKEEPER (OOV)\\nWhat is your quest?\\n\\nGAWAIN (OOV)\\nTo seek the Holy Grail.\\n|\\n| BRIDGEKEEPER (OOV)\\n| What goes: black white ... black white ... black white?\\n|\\n| GAWAIN (OOV)\\n| Oh, er ... Babylon! er ... Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!\\n|\\n| SIR LAUNCELOT stands on the other side of the bridge. In the distance we\\n| hear the ritual of questions and then a scream and thud, suddenly a hand\\n| lands on LAUNCELOT\\'s shoulder.\\n|\\n| POLICEMAN (VOICE OVER)\\n| Just want to ask you some questions, sir.\\n|\\n| LAUNCELOT turns and reacts. He is led away.\\n|\\n|\\n|36 EXTERIOR - LAKE - DAY\\n|\\n| CUT TO ARTHUR, GALAHAD and BEDEVERE struggling towards the lake.\\n|\\n| BEDEVERE\\n| (to ARTHUR)\\n| How did you know how many wing-beats a swallow needs to maintain velocity?\\n|\\n| ARTHUR\\n| Oh ... when you\\'re king you know all those things.\\n+\\n+ BRIDGEKEEPER\\n+ What is your favorite color?\\n+\\n+ GAWAIN\\n+ Blue ...

They look across the water. A\\nhuge expanse disappearing into the mist. How can they cross?\\n\\nSuddenly the air is filled with ethereal music, and out of the mist\\nappears a wonderful barge silently and slowly drifting towards them.\\n\\nThey gaze in wonder. The mysterious boat comes to where they are\\nstanding. As if bewitched, they find themselves drawing closer\\n| to the boat. As they are about to step in, a ragged figure looks up at them.\\n|\\n| BOATKEEPER\\n| (he is the same as the BRIDGEKEEPER and the SOOTHSAYER)\\n| He who would cross the Sea of Fate\\n| must answer me\\n| these questions twenty-eight.\\n|\\n| He fixes them with a baleful eye, ARTHUR and BEDEVERE exchange glances, then\\n| turn, with minds made up, pick him up bodily and throw him in the water.\\n| They climb into the boat and the boat moves off into the mist\\n|\\n| FADE OUT\\n|\\n|\\n|37 ANIMATION\\n|\\n| A wondrous journey in animation carries them across the lake.\\n|\\n| MIX TO\\n\\n\\n38 EXTERIOR - DAY\\n\\nThe boat carries them across a magical lake. They land and get out of\\nthe boat, their faces suffused with heavenly radiance, and fall to\\ntheir knees.\\n\\nCrescendo on music.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nGod be praised! The deaths of many find knights have this day been avenged.\\n\\nMusic swells. They bend their heads in prayer, before the castle for\\nwhich they have searched for so long. Suddenly a voice comes from the\\nbattlements.\\n\\nMusic cuts dead.\\n\\nFROG\\n\\nHa ha! Hello! Smelly English K...niggets ... and Monsieur Arthur King,\\nwho has the brain of a duck, you know.\\n\\nThe KNIGHTS look up.\\n\\nFROG\\nWe French persons outwit you a second time, perfidious English\\nmousedropping hoarders ... how you say: \"Begorrah!\"\\n\\nARTHUR stands and shouts.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nHow dare you profane this place with your presence!
